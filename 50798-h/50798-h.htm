<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Peggy sat writing in the study one
afternoon, a shaggy head came peering
round the door, and Robert's voice said
eagerly:</p>

<p>"Mariquita! A word in your ear!
Could you come out and take a turn
round the garden for half an hour before
tea, or are you too busy?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I am entirely at your
disposal," said Peggy elegantly, and
the young people made their way to
the cloak-room, swung on coats and
sailor-hats, and sallied out into the fresh
autumn air.</p>

<p>"Mariquita," said Robert; then,
using once more the name by which he
chose to address Peggy in their confidential
confabs, "Mariquita, I am in
difficulties. There is a microscope
advertised in <i>Science</i> this week that is
the very thing I have been pining for
for the last six years. I must get it, or
die, but the question is&mdash;<i>how?</i> You
see before you a penniless man." He
looked at Peggy as he spoke, and met
her small, demure smile.</p>

<p>"My dear and honourable sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know; drop that, Mariquita!
Don't take for granted, like
Mellicent, that because a man has a
title he must necessarily be a millionaire.
Everything is comparative! My
father is rich compared to the Vicar,
but he is really hard up for a man in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
position. He gets almost no rent for
his land nowadays, and I am the third
son. I haven't as much pocket-money in
a month as Oswald gets through in a
week. Now that microscope is twenty
pounds, and if I were to ask the governor
for it, he wouldn't give it to me, but he
would sigh and look wretched at being
obliged to refuse. He's a kind-hearted
fellow, you know, who doesn't like to
say 'No,' and I hate to worry him.
Still&mdash;that microscope! I must have
it. By hook or by crook, I must have
it. I've set my mind on that."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I hope you will, though for
my part you must not expect me to
look through it. I like things to be
pretty, and when you see them through
a microscope they generally look hideous.
I saw my own hand once&mdash;ugh!"
Peggy shuddered. "Twenty pounds!
Well, I can only say that my whole
worldly wealth is at your disposal. Draw
on me for anything you like&mdash;up to
seven and six! That's all the money I
have till the beginning of the month."</p>

<p>"Thanks!&mdash;I didn't intend to borrow,
I have a better idea than that. I was
reading a magazine the other day, and
came upon a list of prize competitions.
The first prize offered was thirty pounds,
and I'm going to win that prize. The
microscope costs only twenty pounds, but
the extra ten would come in usefully for&mdash;I'll
tell you about that later on! The
<i>Piccadilly Magazine</i> is very respectable
and all that sort of thing, but the
governor is one of the good old-fashioned,
conservative fellows, who would be
horrified if he saw my name figuring in
it. I'm bound to consider his feelings,
but all the same I'm going to win that
prize. It says in the rules&mdash;I've read
them through carefully&mdash;that you can
ask your friends to help you, so that
there would be nothing unfair about
going into partnership with someone
else. What I was going to suggest
was that you and I should collaborate.
I'd rather work with you than with any of
the others, and I think we could manage
it rather well between us. Our contribution
should be sent in in your name,
that is to say, if you wouldn't object to
seeing yourself in print."</p>

<p>"I should love it. I'm proud of my
name, and it would be a new sensation."
But Peggy spoke in absent-minded
fashion, as if her thoughts were running
on another subject. Rob had used a
word which was unfamiliar in her ears,
a big word, a word with a delightful,
intellectual roll, and she had not the
remotest idea of its meaning. Collaborate!
Beautiful! Not for worlds
would she confess her ignorance, yet
the opportunity could not be thrown
away. She must secure the treasure
and add it to her mental store. She
put her head on one side, and said
pensively:</p>

<p>"I shall be most happy to er&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;In
what other words can I exactly express
'collaborate,' Rob? I do so object to
repetition!"</p>

<p>"Go shags!" returned Robert
briefly. "I would do the biggest part
of the work, of course, that's only fair,
because I want two-thirds of the money,
but you could do what you liked, and
have ten pounds for your share. Ten
pounds would come in very usefully for
Christmas."</p>

<p>"Rather! I'd get mother and father
lovely presents, and Mrs. Asplin too;
and buy books for Esther, and a little
gold ring for Mellicent&mdash;it's her idea of
happiness to have a gold ring. I'll
help you with pleasure, Rob, and I'm
sure we shall get the prize. What have
we to do? Make up some poetry?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, no! Fancy me making
up poetry! It's to make up a calendar.
There are subjects given for each month&mdash;sorrow,
love, obedience, resignation&mdash;that
sort of thing, and you have to give
a quotation for each day. It will take
some time, but we ought to stand a
good chance. You are fond of reading,
and know no end of poetry, and where I
have a pull is in knowing French and
German so well. I can give them some
fine translations from the Latin and Greek
too, for the matter of that, and it will
look kind of swagger to put the authors'
names underneath. That will impress
the judges, and make 'em decide in our
favour. I've been working at it only
three days, and I've got over fifty
quotations already. We must keep
note-books in our pockets, and jot down
any ideas that occur to us during the
day, and go over them together at night.
You will know a lot, I'm sure."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Sorrow and silence are strong, and patient endurance is godlike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore accomplish thy labour of love, till the heart is made godlike,'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>quoted Peggy with an air, and Rob
nodded approval.</p>

<p>"That's it! That's the style! Something
with a bit of a sermon in it to keep
'em up to the mark for the day. Bravo,
Mariquita! you'll do it splendidly.
That's settled then. We shall have to
work hard, for there is only a month
before the thing must be sent off, and
we must finish in good time. When
you leave things to the last, something
is bound to come in the way. It will
take an age to write out three hundred
and sixty-five extracts."</p>

<p>"It will indeed, for they must be very
nicely done," said Peggy fastidiously.
"Of course it is most important that
the extracts themselves should be good,
but it matters almost as much that they
should look neat and attractive. Appearances
go such a long way." And when
Robert demurred and stated his opinion
that the judges would not trouble their
heads about looks, she stuck firmly to
her point.</p>

<p>"Oh, won't they though. Just
imagine how you would feel if you were
in their position, and had to look over
scores of ugly uninteresting manuscripts.
You would be bored to death, and after
plodding conscientiously through a few
dozen, you would get so mixed up that
you would hardly be able to distinguish
one from another. Then suddenly&mdash;suddenly"&mdash;Peggy
clasped her hands
with one of her favourite dramatic
gestures&mdash;"you would see before you a
dainty little volume prettily written, easy
to read, easy to hold, nice to look at,
and do you mean to say that your heart
wouldn't give a jump, and that you
would not take a fancy to the writer
from that very moment? Of course you
would, and so, if you please, I am going
to look after the decorative department
and see what can be done. I must give
my mind to it&mdash;&mdash;Oh! I'll tell you what
would be just the thing. When I was
in the library one day lately I saw some
sweet little note-books with pale green
leaves and gilt edges. I'll count the
pages, and buy enough to make up
three hundred and sixty-five, and twelve
extra, so as to put one plain sheet
between each month. Then we must
have a cover. Two pieces of cardboard
would do, with gilt edges, and a motto
in old English letters, 'The months in
circling orbit fly.' Have I read that
somewhere, or did I make it up? It
sounds very well. Well, what next?"
Peggy was growing quite excited, and
the restless hands were waving about at
a great rate. "Oh, the pages! We
shall have to put the date at the top of
each. I could do that in gold ink, and
make a pretty little skriggle&mdash;er&mdash;'<i>arabesque</i>,'
I should say, underneath
to give it a finish. Then I'd hand them
on to you to write the extracts in your
tiny little writing. Rob, it will be
splendid! Do you really think we shall
get the prize?"</p>

<p>"I <i>mean</i> to get it! We have a good
library here, and plenty of time if we
like to use it. I'm going to get up at
six every morning. I sha'n't fail for
want of trying, and if I miss this I'll
win something else. My mind is made
up! I'm going to buy that microscope!"
Robert tossed his head and looked
ferocious, while Peggy peered in his
rugged face, and womanlike admired
him the more for his determination.</p>

<p>They lingered in the garden discussing
details, planning out the work, and
arranging as to the different books to
be overlooked until the tea hour was
passed, and Mrs. Asplin came to the
door and called to them to come in.</p>

<p>"And nothing on your feet but your
thin slippers? Oh, you Peggy!" she
exclaimed in despair. "Now you will
have a cold, and ten to one it will fly to
your throat. I shall have to fine you a
penny every time you cross the doorstep
without changing your shoes. Summer
is over, remember. You can't be too
careful in these raw, damp days. Run
upstairs this minute and change your
stockings."</p>

<p>Peggy looked meek, and went to her
room at once to obey orders; but the
mischief was done, she shivered and
could not get warm, her head ached,
and her eyes felt heavy. Mrs. Asplin
looked anxiously at her in the drawing-room
after dinner, and finally called her
to her side.</p>

<p>"Peggy, come here! Aren't you well?
Let me feel your hand. Child, it's like
a coal! You are in a fever. Why
didn't you tell me at once?"</p>

<p>"Because I&mdash;really, it's nothing, Mrs.
Asplin! Don't be worried. I don't
know why I feel so hot. I was shivering
only a minute ago."</p>

<p>"Go straight upstairs and take a
dose of ammoniated quinine. Turn on
the fire in your room. Max! Robert!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
Oswald! Esther! Mellicent! will everyone
please look after Peggy in the
future, and see that she does not run
out in her slippers!" cried Mrs. Asplin
in a despairing voice, and Peggy bolted
out of the door in haste, to escape before
more reproaches could be hurled at
her head.</p>

<p>But an alarm of a more serious nature
than a threatened cold was to take place
before the evening was over. The young
people answered briefly, Mrs. Asplin
turned back to her book, and silence
settled down upon the occupants of the
drawing-room. It was half-past eight,
the servants had carried away the
dinner things, and were enjoying their
evening's rest in the kitchen. The
Vicar was nodding in his easy-chair,
the house was so quiet that the tick of
the old grandfather clock in the hall
could be heard through the half-opened
door. Then suddenly came the sound
of flying footsteps, the door burst open,
and in rushed Peggy once more, but
such a Peggy, such an apparition of
fear, suffering, and terror as brought a
cry of consternation from every lip.
Her eyes were starting from her head,
her face was contorted in spasmodic
gaspings for breath, her arms sawed
the air like the sails of a windmill, and
she flew round and round the room in a
wild, unheeding rush.</p>

<p>"Peggy, my child! my child! what
is the matter? Oh, Austin&mdash;oh! What
shall we do?" cried Mrs. Asplin, trying
to catch hold of the flying arms, only to
be waved off with frenzied energy.
Mellicent dissolved into tears and
retreated behind the sofa, under the
impression that Peggy had suddenly
taken leave of her senses, and practical
Esther rushed upstairs to search for a
clue to the mystery among the medicine
bottles on Peggy's table. She was
absent only for a few minutes; but it
seemed like an hour to the watchers,
for Peggy's face grew more and more
agonised, she seemed on the verge of
suffocation, and could neither speak,
nor endure anyone to approach within
yards of her mad career. Presently,
however, she began to falter, to draw
her breath in longer gasps, and as she
did so there emerged from her lips a
series of loud whooping sounds, like
the crowing of a cock, or the noise made
by a child in the convulsions of whooping-cough.
The air was making its
way to the lungs after the temporary
stoppage, and the result would have
been comical if any of the hearers had
been in a mood for jesting, which, in
good truth, they were not.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven! She will be better
now. Open the window and leave her
alone. Don't try to make her speak.
What in the world has the child been
doing?" cried the Vicar wonderingly;
and at that moment Esther entered,
bearing in her hand the explanation of
the mystery&mdash;a bottle labelled "Spirits
of Ammonia," and a tumbler about an
eighth full of a white milky-looking fluid.</p>

<p>"They were in the front of the table.
The other things had not been moved.
I believe she has never looked at the
labels, but seized the first bottle that
came to her hand&mdash;this dreadfully strong
ammonia which you gave her for the
gnat bites when she just came."</p>

<p>A groan of assent came from the sofa
on which Peggy lay, choking no longer,
but ghastly white, and drawing her
breath in painful gasps. Mrs. Asplin
sniffed at the contents of the tumbler,
only to jerk back her head with watery
eyes and reddened lids.</p>

<p>"No wonder that the child was nearly
choked! The marvel is that she had
ever regained her breath after such a
mistake. Her throat must be raw!"
She hurried out of the room to concoct
a soothing draught, at which Peggy
supped at intervals during the evening,
croaking out a hoarse, "Better, thank
you!" in reply to inquiries, and looking
so small and pathetic in her nest of
cushions that the hearts of the beholders
softened at the sight. Before bedtime,
however, she revived considerably, and
her elastic spirits coming to her aid,
entertained the listeners with a husky
but dramatic account of her proceedings.
How she had not troubled to turn the
gas full up, and had just seized the
bottle, tilted some of the contents into a
tumbler in which there was a small
portion of water, without troubling to
measure it out, and gulped it down without
delay. Her description of the feelings
which ensued was a really clever piece of
word painting, but behind the pretence
of horror at her own carelessness, there
rang a hardly-concealed note of pride,
as though, in thus risking her life, she
had done something quite clever and
distinguished.</p>

<p>Mrs. Asplin exhausted herself in
"Ohs!" and "Ahs!" of sympathy,
and had nothing harsher to say than&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, now, dearie, you'll be more
careful another time, won't you?" But
the Vicar's long face grew longer than
ever as he listened, and the lines
deepened in his forehead. Peggy was
inexperienced in danger signals, but
Esther and Mellicent recognised the
well-known signs, and were at no loss
to understand the meaning of that quiet
"A word with you in the study, Mariquita,
if you please!" with which he rose
from the breakfast-table next morning.</p>

<p>Peggy's throat was still sore, and she
fondly imagined that anxiety on its
behalf was the cause of the summons,
but she was speedily undeceived, for
the Vicar motioned towards a chair, and
said, in short grave sentences, as his
manner was when annoyed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish to speak to you about the
event of last night, my dear. I am
afraid that you hardly realise the matter
in its true light. I was not at all
pleased with the manner in which you
gave your explanation. You appeared
to imagine that you had done something
clever and amusing. I take a very
different view. You showed a reprehensible
carelessness in trifling with
medicines in the dark; it might have
caused you your life, or, at best, a
serious injury. As it was, you brought
pain upon yourself, and gave us all a
serious alarm. I see nothing amusing
in such behaviour, but consider it
stupid, and careless to an almost
criminal extent."</p>

<p>Peggy stood motionless, eyes cast
down, hands clasped before her, a
picture of injured innocence. She did
not say a word in self-defence, but her
feelings were so plainly written on her
face that the Vicar's eyes flashed with
impatience.</p>

<p>"Well, what have you to say?"</p>

<p>Peggy sighed in dolorous fashion.</p>

<p>"I am sorry; I know it was careless.
I am always doing things like that. So
is Arthur. So was father when he was
a boy. It's in the family. It's unfortunate,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mariquita," said the Vicar sternly,
"you are <i>not</i> sorry! If I had seen that
you were penitent, I should not have
spoken, for you would have been
sufficiently punished by your own
sufferings, but you are not sorry; you
are, on the whole, rather proud of the
escapade! Look into your own heart
and see if it is not so?"</p>

<p>He paused, looking at her with grave,
expectant eyes, but there was no sign of
conviction upon the set face. The eyes
were still lowered, the lips drooped with
an expression of patient endurance.
There was silence in the room while
Peggy studied the carpet, and the Vicar
gazed at her downcast face. A moment
before he had been on the verge of
anger, but the sternness melted away in
that silence, and gave place to an
anxious tenderness. Here was a little
human soul committed to his care&mdash;how
could he help? how best guide and
train? The long, grave face grew
beautiful in that moment with the
expression which it wore every Sunday
as he gazed around the church at the
beginning of the sermon, noting this
one and that, having a swift realisation
of their needs and failings, and breathing
a prayer to God that He would give to
his lips the right word, to his heart the
right thought to meet the needs of his
people. Evidently sternness and outspoken
blame was not the best way to
touch the girl before him. He must try
another mode.</p>

<p>"Peggy," he said quietly, "do you
think you realise what a heavy responsibility
we laid upon ourselves when we
undertook the care of you for these
three years? If any accident happened
to you beneath our roof, have you ever
imagined what would be our misery and
remorse at sending the news to your
parents? About their feelings I do not
speak; you can realise them for yourself.
We safeguard you with every
precaution in our power; we pray
morning and night that you may be
preserved in safety; is it too much to
ask that you will do your part by
showing more forethought, and by
exercising some little care in the daily
duties of life? I ask it for our sakes as
well as your own."</p>

<p>A faint pink flush spread over Peggy's
cheeks; she gulped nervously and raised
her eyes to the Vicar's face. Twice her
lips opened as if to speak, but the
natural reserve, which made it agony to
her to express her deepest feelings,
closed them again before a word had
been spoken. The question was not
answered, but a little hand shot out and
nestled in Mr. Asplin's with a spasmodic
grip which was full of eloquence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I know you will! I know
you will!" he said, answering the
unspoken promise, and looking down
at her with one of his sweet, kindly
smiles. "It will be a comfort to my
wife as well as myself. She is very
nervous about you. She was upstairs
three times in the night to satisfy
herself that you were well after your
fright, and is too tired herself to come
downstairs this morning. She is always
bright and cheery, but she is not very
strong. You would be sorry to make
her ill."</p>

<p>No answer, only another grip of the
hand, and a sudden straightening of
the lips as if they were pressed together
to avoid an involuntary trembling.
There is something especially touching
in the sight of restrained emotion, and
as the Vicar thought of his own two
daughters, his heart was very tender
over the girl whose parents were
separated from her by six thousand
miles of land and sea.</p>

<p>"Well, now, dear, I have said my say
and that is an end of it. I don't like
finding fault, but my dear wife has
thrown that duty on my shoulders by
being too tender-hearted to say a word
of blame even when it is needed. Her
method works very well, as a rule, but
there are occasions when it would be
criminal to withhold a just reprimand."
The Vicar stopped short and a spasm of
laughter crossed his face. Peggy's
fingers had twitched within his own as
he spoke those last two words, and her
eyes had dilated with interest. He
knew as well as if he had been told
that she was gloating over the new
expression, and mentally noting it for
future use. Nothing, however, could
have been sweeter or more natural than
the manner in which she sidled against
him, and murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you so much. I am sorry!
I will truly try," and he watched her
out of the room with a smile of tender
amusement.</p>

<p>"A nice child&mdash;a good child&mdash;feels
deeply. I can rely upon her to do her
best."</p>

<p>Robert was hanging about in the
passage, ready, as usual, to fulfil his
vows of support, and Peggy slid her
hand through his arm and sauntered
slowly with him towards the schoolroom.
Like the two girls, he had
been at no loss to understand the
reason of the call to the study, and
would fain have expressed his sympathy,
but Peggy stopped him with
uplifted finger.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;he was perfectly right. You
must not blame him. I have been
guilty of reprehensible carelessness, and
merited a reprimand!"</p>

<h3>PART I.</h3>

<p class='ph3'>AN EVENING AT A GIRLS' CLUB.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I first</span> made Belinda Ann's acquaintance at
a social evening at a club in Bethnal Green to
which I had been invited by the lady who had
instituted it.</p>

<p>In my innocence and ignorance (for at that
time I was unacquainted with the manners
and customs of the East End) I took my little
roll of music in my hand, thinking I should
be expected to contribute to the evening's
entertainment; but on arrival I found that
this was not necessary, as the girls were quite
capable of amusing themselves and us too.</p>

<p>On certain occasions a fixed programme was
arranged and carried out by friends from the
West End, but this happened to be an "off
night," when the members did pretty much
as they pleased, my hostess leaving them to
their own devices entirely, and not interfering
unless their spirits threatened to get too
boisterous.</p>

<p>As she truly said: "You cannot expect the
same manners and etiquette here that you find
among Lady Clara Vere de Vere and her
friends at their aristocratic club near Grosvenor
Square, but my girls have a great sense of
honour and chivalry, and a word from me is
generally sufficient."</p>

<p>The club-room was at the back of a large,
old-fashioned house which at one time, long,
long ago, stood in its own extensive grounds in
the midst of a peaceful, rural neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Now it was hemmed in on all sides by
streets and houses teeming with life, and the
only relic of its former grandeur left was a tiny
piece of ground in front.</p>

<p>Still, a certain air of aristocratic calm hung
about it, and after my recent long drive
through the hot, crowded streets, I breathed a
sigh of relief when the front door closed
behind me and I found myself in the spacious
entrance-hall.</p>

<p>I followed the neat maid-servant (herself an
East Ender born and bred) along this out
into a little paved yard, which we crossed,
and up a flight of break-neck stairs into the
club-room.</p>

<p>It was a long, narrow apartment, with a
low platform at one end, and the wooden
walls were hung with gay-coloured bunting
interspersed with various flags, a few pictures
from Christmas numbers, and some framed
texts.</p>

<p>Odd strips of carpet, matting and rugs,
covered the floor and on these stood small
tables laden with magazines, books and games,
while little chairs stood here and there not in
stiff rows but in conversational attitudes, so to
speak.</p>

<p>A fixed bench ran all round the walls, a
piano (rather the worse for wear inside and out)
stood in one corner of the platform, and a few
plants in pots disguised by crinkled paper
completed the furniture.</p>

<p>Judging from the noise that greeted me
when I entered, the lungs of Belinda Ann
and her friends were in fairly good condition,
and I felt distinctly alarmed as I advanced,
for they all turned and stared at me with one
consent, making frank and audible remarks
on my personal appearance and dress.</p>

<p>The room was crowded with girls, tall and
short, dark and fair, fat and thin, very few of
whom were playing games or reading, but all
of whom were chattering as fast as their
tongues would let them.</p>

<p>I was relieved when the lady who had
invited me stepped forward to shake hands
and at once piloted me up the room (for she
knew I wanted to learn all I could about my
East End sisters) whispering as she went,
"I'm going to introduce Belinda Ann to you.
You'll find out all you want to know from
her," and next minute I found myself deposited
next a girl who surveyed me with a mixture
of good-humoured contempt and watchful
suspicion.</p>

<p>The first was due to my small size, the
second to a lurking conviction that I wanted
to patronise, or as she afterwards expressed it,
"Come the toff over her."</p>

<p>As soon as she found out I was far from
wishing to do this, she became more friendly,
and assured my hostess that she'd take care of
the "lydy."</p>

<p>Belinda Ann was a head and shoulders
taller than myself and broad in proportion,
although she was only eighteen. She
possessed a quantity of black hair which
came down to her eyebrows in front in a
thick, straight fringe and was beautifully
bright and clean. Brown eyes looked fearlessly
at you from under the fringe, and her
whole manner was that of a girl who, ever
since she could walk, had had to fight for
herself and protect herself, and had done it too.</p>

<p>You couldn't imagine anyone taking a
liberty with Belinda Ann, although she was
hail-fellow-well-met with everyone.</p>

<p>She might be a little rough in her manners,
and not always too refined in her speech, but
Belinda Ann had a heart of gold, was as true
as steel to her friends, and thoroughly enjoyed
life, taking the sweet with the bitter, spending
money royally when she had it, and cheerfully
going without when times were bad.</p>

<p>This evening she was attired in a peacock-blue
cashmere and plush dress, which had
seen its best days, almost covered by a large
apron, not so clean as it had once been, and
surmounted by a limp black straw hat adorned
with some dejected-looking black feathers
without a vestige of curl about them, and
various dirty white flowers which flopped
aimlessly over the brim.</p>

<p>I noticed that her boots were strong and
good, and that near her lay a thick, handsome
shawl, and in time I learnt that these two
items of dress rank next in importance to the
famous feathers, and that every true East
Ender insists on having them of the best
quality, and pays a good price for them.</p>

<p>Belinda Ann, meanwhile, having exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
her interest in me, was turning to exchange
"chaff" with her other neighbour, when,
with an inward gasp, I plunged boldly into
conversation.</p>

<p>"Do you come here every evening?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Depends!" was the abrupt answer, given
in an off-hand, defiant sort of way which
characterised her manner with strangers.
"P'raps I do an' p'raps I don't!" and her
look so plainly added, "What's it to you?"
that I refrained from pursuing the subject.</p>

<p>"You all seem very lively," I hazarded
next, with a look round.</p>

<p>"So you'd be to get a chance to do somethin'
beside work!" was the fierce reply.</p>

<p>This made a capital opening to the question
I was longing to lead up to,
namely, "What do you do all
day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm engyged in chemistry,"
was the proud reply,
accompanied by a visible swelling
of her whole person.</p>

<p>"Chemistry!" I ejaculated,
rather awe-struck at finding her
so clever.</p>

<p>"'Ere, don't you believe
'er!" struck in a fair, florid
girl next her on the other side.
"She's bluffin' yer! She only
sticks the lybels on the bottles
at the cord-liver oil factry over
the wy."</p>

<p>Whereupon Belinda Ann,
with perfect good-humour,
made a grab at the other's hat
and a friendly little tussle ensued,
accompanied by shrieks
of laughter and a brisk interchange
of chaff.</p>

<p>As soon as this interlude
was over and they had once
more settled down, I took
up the thread of conversation
again.</p>

<p>"And are all these girls
engaged in sticking&mdash;&mdash;I
mean, in the chemistry?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"No," she retorted; "some's
jam an' some's pickles, but the
jams are a low lot!" and the
air of inexpressible scorn with
which she said it would not
have disgraced a West End
beauty alluding to another,
"who is not in our set, my
dear."</p>

<p>I began to think my hostess
had made a mistake in assigning
me to Belinda Ann, as the latter
seemed more disposed to snub
me than anything else, and I
was rather relieved when the
piano struck up and the girls
began to dance.</p>

<p>There were no men present,
but this did not at all interfere with their
happiness, and I sat lost in amazement at
their extraordinary agility and wonderful steps.</p>

<p>Belinda Ann (or as I heard her friends call
her, Blinderann) was in no wise behind the
others, and sprang hither and thither with the
best.</p>

<p>My hostess sank into a seat beside me and
murmured apologetically&mdash;</p>

<p>"I let them do this to work off a little
of their exuberant spirits, for they would never
sit still a whole evening, and would fight
probably if they had no other outlet. Some
nights, if there is any specially good concert or
entertainment, I allow each girl to bring one
male relative or friend, but oddly enough they
don't often avail themselves of the permission.
On an informal evening like this, when there
are only girls, I don't think a little physical
exercise does them any harm, and it tires them
out so that they will listen to anything I have
to say to them afterwards. If I drew the rein
too tight, they would all disperse to the four
winds and I should never get hold of them
again."</p>

<p>I agreed, and presently seeing a girl leaning
up against the wall, I plucked up courage and
asked her if she would care to have me as a
partner.</p>

<p>She seemed slightly surprised, but consented
graciously, and we took a few turns together.</p>

<p>I flattered myself I had got on fairly well,
and felt so elated at my success that by-and-by
I sought Belinda Ann, who was fanning
herself vigorously with her hat, and requested
the pleasure.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350">
<img src="images/i_197.jpg" width="350" height="486" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ENVY.</div>
</div>

<p>Her answer rather stunned me.</p>

<p>"No, thank'ee. I've been watchin' yer
an' your style won't do fer me!"</p>

<p>Before I had time to reply she was off
again, taking part in some very pretty figures
in which narrow coloured ribbons were plaited
and unplaited as the girls holding the ends
moved hither and thither.</p>

<p>As soon as everyone was thoroughly tired
and disposed to sit quiet for half an hour or
so, a girl (a stranger from the West End like
myself) was asked by the hostess to play
something, and accordingly, thinking as I
should have done, that they preferred lively
tunes, sat down and began to rattle off some
"catchy" popular airs.</p>

<p>She was unceremoniously stopped by
Belinda Ann&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Ere, we don't want that rot!"</p>

<p>"Oh," mildly replied the unfortunate
pianist, not quite knowing what to say; "I
thought you liked variety?"</p>

<p>"No, we don't," retorted the other, misunderstanding
her and thinking she meant
the music hall close by; "the V'riety costs
tuppence an' we can't 'ford it."</p>

<p>"Well, what would you like?" was the
inquiry.</p>

<p>"Give us 'We are rout on the ocean syling,'
or 'God be with you till we meet agyne,'"
and this request being complied with, these
favourite hymns were shouted out at the top of
their voices, Belinda Ann's in particular being
like a clarion.</p>

<p>After this a diversion was created by one of
the "pickles" volunteering a recitation which
she gave with a good deal of
dramatic power; then another
girl sang a little song, and
Belinda Ann followed with a
second, and so the evening wore
away to its close; but I felt dissatisfied,
for I seemed no nearer
attaining my object than before.</p>

<p>Taking the opportunity, I
forcibly detained Belinda Ann
as she was drifting by, and
diffidently observed&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've told me what you
work at, but how do you amuse
yourself?"</p>

<p>"'Ow? There ain't much
difficulty 'bout that!" she returned
scornfully. "There's
this sort o' thing, an' bank
'ollerdys, an' weddins, an'
funerals, an' launchin' ships,
an'&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd let me go
with you to some of these!" I
eagerly interrupted.</p>

<p>She looked dubiously at me
for a minute, thinking I was
joking, but seeing I was in
earnest, remarked casually&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind ef I
do, but it's a bit rough sometimes
fer the likes o' you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I sha'n't mind," I
joyfully replied. "When can
I begin?"</p>

<p>"A friend o' mine's goin' to
be married the dy after ter-morrer,"
she said graciously.
"I could get yer an invite, if
yer liked."</p>

<p>"Do!" was my ecstatic response.
"Where shall we
meet?"</p>

<p>"'Ere," she returned. "Yer
can't go wanderin' about these
streets by yerself, an' it
wouldn't do fer your grand
friends to see me a-knockin' at
your door!"</p>

<p>I was trying in vain to assure
her that she was quite wrong,
when she suddenly rammed her hat viciously
down on her head, slung her shawl round
her like a woollen whirlwind, and with the
brief remark, "G'night," was gone. I
also soon afterwards took my leave, having
first told my hostess about the proposed
expedition.</p>

<p>She looked a little anxious, but her face
cleared when she heard that Belinda Ann was
coming with me.</p>

<p>"That's all right," she observed, with a
sigh of relief. "She's to be trusted to see
that you come to no harm; but don't leave
her for a minute, and don't wear jewellery or
carry much money."</p>

<p>I promised, and went home full of anticipation
at the idea of the new world about to
open before my delighted eyes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_198.jpg" width="125" height="184" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">After</span> the death of Jean
D'Albret a hundred
years or more passed before
any Queen distinguished
herself specially
as a needlewoman, and
by the time Queen Mary,
Princess of Orange, came to the
throne, needlework as an employment
for the high-born had quite
gone out of fashion.</p>

<p>She, however, seemed to have
the love of it born in her. Every
hour not occupied with devotion and business
was spent by her in all kinds of needlework;
in fact, she worked so well and so constantly
that one might have supposed she was earning
her daily bread.</p>

<p>She regarded idleness as the greatest
corrupter of human nature, and she believed
that if the mind had no employment it would
create some of the worst sort for itself.</p>

<p>She tried to impress this upon the ladies of
her Court, who had fallen into sad habits of
idleness which, she assured them, not only
wasted their time, but exposed them to many
temptations.</p>

<p>It was to remedy this and to imbue them
with her love of work that she assembled her
ladies every day and worked with them for
two or three hours, and while thus employed,
one was appointed to read aloud some
interesting book.</p>

<p>As usual, the Queen's example was followed
by all classes of women and girls in the
kingdom, and it became as much the fashion
to work as it had been to be idle.</p>

<p>This example came in the very nick of time,
for it was stated on good authority, that
"women had become quite mischievous from
lack of employment."</p>

<p>This action of the Queen, which seems but
a small thing, was in reality a great step
towards bettering the age.</p>

<p>For proofs of this Queen's own beautiful
work, one has only to go to Hampton Court
Palace where much of it is still to be seen.</p>

<p>(Before leaving the seventeenth century, I
should like to mention a quaint fact. It is,
that a Catherine Sloper is buried in the
cloisters of Westminster Abbey&mdash;date 1620.
Her epitaph is, "Exquisite at her needle." I
thought it so curious, standing alone as it does.)</p>

<p>Coming to the middle of the eighteenth
century, we find a group of royal needlewomen,
most of whom found help and
comfort in the art of needlework.</p>

<p>What, for example, would poor Marie
Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI., have done
without it in prison, or Josephine, wife of
Napoleon, in her retirement, or Queen
Charlotte in her domestic sorrow?</p>

<p>To begin with Marie Antoinette. She was
devoted to needlework, even in her happy and
prosperous days. In her own private room at
Versailles the low chairs surrounding that in
which she usually sat were always full of
workbaskets and bags containing wools, silks,
and canvas; these, together with the
beautiful designs for the tapestry, were
bought at the firm of Dubuquoy.</p>

<p>The Queen's hands were never idle; she
was like a busy bee always at work even when
chatting with friends and visitors or waiting
with her bonnet on for the King to walk with
her.</p>

<p>Not only was she clever at embroidery and
tapestry, but she could both mend and make
her dresses, her mantles, and under-linen;
she could also trim her hats and mend her shoes.</p>

<p>Madame Elizabeth, her sister-in-law, who
was with her all through her sorrow, was
equally clever with her needle, and the two
together have left some beautiful work in silk
and wool on canvas.</p>

<p>When she quitted her life at Versailles, she
did not give up her needlework; but inquietude
and anxiety assailed her as she feverishly
sorted her wools in the Tuileries, hearing all
the time the menaces and threats of the
howling crowd outside.</p>

<p>Both in the Tuileries and in the Temple
the Queen and Madame Elizabeth did very
simple work, that is to say, work not requiring
concentration of thought, which would have
been impossible for them under the circumstances.
One can picture them, silent and sad,
with heads bent and speaking little, while
their needles passed in and out the canvas
watered with tears.</p>

<p>Yet so long as they were allowed to work
there was some comfort left them, something
wherewith to beguile the time.</p>

<p>Pauline de Tourzelle, the daughter of the
governess, was taken with the Royal Family
when they were imprisoned in the Temple,
but she had no dress save that she had on.
As some of Madame Elizabeth's clothes had
arrived, she gave the girl one of her dresses,
but it did not fit her, therefore the Queen
and Madame Elizabeth set to work and
re-made it.</p>

<p>One of the pieces of work Marie Antoinette
did in the Temple fell into the hands of the
Bernard family at Lille, by whom it is greatly
treasured.</p>

<p>The account of the way the Royal Family
passed their time in the Temple is very
pathetic. When at four o'clock the King
slept in his arm-chair, the Queen and Princesses
worked at their tapestry or knitting,
while the little Dauphin learnt his lessons,
and after the King had retired for the night
they mended their clothes or those of the
King and the Dauphin.</p>

<p>It is stated that the King's coat became
ragged, and as Madame Elizabeth mended it,
she had to bite off the thread with her teeth,
as the scissors had been taken away.</p>

<p>So long as they were allowed to employ
themselves with needlework there was comfort
for them, and yet more, for by their work
they were able to keep up some sort of
correspondence with their friends outside the
prison. It is just possible that the jailors
had a suspicion of this. Anyhow, the time
came when all their sewing materials and
tools were taken from them and they were
desolate indeed.</p>

<p>Subsequently when Marie Antoinette was
removed to the Conciergerie, a place of confinement
of the lowest order, her suffering
was greatly increased at not being allowed to
work. The jailors refused even knitting-needles.
At length the thought came to her
of drawing out some threads from the stuffing
of her bed, which, with two wooden skewers,
she knitted into garters.</p>

<p>Some of the work done by Marie Antoinette
and Madame Elizabeth during the last two
years of their lives is still in existence, and
consists of hangings six feet by four. The
groundwork of the tapestry is in black wool,
with bouquets of flowers, roses, pinks, and
convolvulus, on coarse canvas.</p>

<p>Some of these hangings were acquired by
Rome in 1881.</p>

<p>The Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon
Buonaparte, both loved and excelled in the
art of needlework, and it certainly was of the
greatest possible comfort and solace to her
during the years of her retirement.</p>

<p>Like Marie Antoinette, she always worked
at her embroidery or tapestry when receiving
her most intimate friends, and chatting with
them late in the evening.</p>

<p>After her separation from Napoleon she
took up her abode in beautiful Malmaison,
where, between botany and needlework, she
spent most of her time. The hangings of the
saloon were entirely her own work, and the
exquisite furniture of her drawing-room was
upholstered in embroidery and tapestry worked
by herself and her ladies in previous happy years.</p>

<p>Needlework was not infrequently put on
one side during the evening hours, in order
that Josephine, her ladies, and guests, might
make lint for the Sisters of Charity, who were
greatly in need of it for the wounded soldiers.</p>

<p>We now come to our Queen Charlotte,
wife of George III. Had it not been for the
intense delight she took in the cultivation of
decorative needlework, the art itself might
have been forgotten.</p>

<p>She was not only very fond of needlework,
but exceedingly anxious that the Princesses
should excel in the art.</p>

<p>In the room where she usually sat with her
family were some cane-bottom chairs, and as
an amusement in their play hours she taught
the little Princesses the different stitches on
this rough substitute for canvas. As the
children grew older a portion of each day was
devoted to needlework, and with their mother
for teacher they became very accomplished
needlewomen.</p>

<p>The Queen herself embroidered the dresses
which the Princesses wore on the coming of
age of the Prince of Wales. They were
white crpe embroidered with silver.</p>

<p>She worked several sets of chairs, which are
now at Frogmore and Windsor. These she
did in her early days. Later in life she employed
herself almost entirely with knitting.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal, when only ten years
old, was such an accomplished needlewoman
that she worked a suit of rich embroidery for
her brother, the Prince of Wales, which he
wore on his birthday.</p>

<p>Queen Charlotte used to find the strict
English Sunday hang heavily on her hands.
Her industrious fingers "ached," as she said,
"for employment. If I read all day my poor
eyes get tired. I do not like to go to sleep,
so I lock my door that nobody may be shocked,
and take my knitting for a little while, and
then I read a good book again."</p>

<p>Her chief delight was needlework. When
in the morning the weather was unfavourable,
her Majesty occupied herself with needlework,
and in the afternoon she worked while the
King read to her.</p>

<p>When it was known that the British troops
in Holland required flannel waistcoats to
screen them from the severe cold and insalubrity
of the soil, the Queen Charlotte sent
to London immediately for a large quantity of
flannel, and she and the elder Princesses cut
out several dozens on the very day it was sent.
The poor in the neighbourhood of Windsor
were employed in making the waistcoats.</p>

<p>One of her most important acts in connection
with needlework was the establishment of an
institution for training and educating in an
accomplished manner the daughters of poor
clergy and decayed tradesmen.</p>

<p>She purchased a house and grounds in
Buckinghamshire, where a lady of high attainments
was placed at a salary of 500 a year
to instruct the pupils in plain needlework,
embroidery, and tapestry.</p>

<p>The work done in this institution was
exquisite. For example, the dresses worn at
Court on New Year's Day, 1787, by Queen
Charlotte and the two elder Princesses were
made there. The state bed of Queen Charlotte,
together with several ottomans now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
Hampton Court Palace, which are highly-finished
pieces of embroidery, were executed
by the pupils in this school.</p>

<p>Few people knew how much good Queen
Charlotte did in a quiet way.</p>

<p>One never thinks of Catherine II. of Russia
as devoting any time to needlework, yet we
find that she worked and presented to Voltaire
a likeness of herself, which he placed in his
chamber at Ferney. It is still in existence in
Ferney, but very much faded, and instead of
hanging on the wall as formerly in the place
of honour, it is now placed in a dark corner of
the room.</p>

<p>Once again needlework took a back place
until our Queen Adelaide introduced it as a
fashion, and required of all ladies who were
invited guests at her Court that they should
be good needlewomen, otherwise she could
not receive them.</p>

<p>It was a bold thing to do even for a queen,
but it turned out well, causing ladies who took
it up for convenience to become skilled workers
and to like the occupation. Queen Adelaide
herself was a beautiful needlewoman, and set
an example to all her people.</p>

<p>Thus we have seen how our queens have
kept alive the useful and ornamental art of
needlework&mdash;an art invented by woman and
kept going by her for the necessities, comfort,
and ornament of the whole peoples of the world.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson says: "Women have a great
advantage, viz., that they may take up with
little things without disgracing themselves; a
man cannot except by fiddling." I suppose
he refers to needlework.</p>

<p>It is an occupation that allows the thoughts
and tongue of the worker full liberty; indeed,
it is woman's pretty excuse for thought.</p>

<p>We have noted its power in the lives of
the highest of the land&mdash;how it soothes
sorrow, calms the troubled mind, and causes
solitary hours to pass more pleasantly, and,
as asserted by some rude man, it keeps us
women out of mischief. But whatever it
does or does not do, it is without doubt
a gentle, graceful, elegant, and feminine
occupation.</p>

<p>These papers would not be complete without
mentioning the work of our dear Queen
Victoria, who in her moments of leisure knits
warm garments for the poor. These may
be seen in many a cottage round about
Balmoral.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class='ph3'>THE JOURNEY DOWN SOUTH. HOUSEKEEPING.
CHINAMEN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> journey from San Francisco to San
Miguel, some six hundred miles, we took by
steamer, and it was the most delightful
episode of all our Californian experiences. It
was the month of April, and with exquisite
weather; the sea was like a pond, so calm
and still; the sun was not too hot, and there
were numberless interesting living things to
watch as we moved along the summer sea.
Several enormous whales went past, generally
in couples, their great fat backs rising out of the
water side by side, and passing our boat swiftly
and with the greatest ease, when we would
see them in a few moments, far in the distance,
spurting up big fountains of spray. Not far
off from the whales were generally flocks of
the tiny whale birds, which seemed to use these
monsters as their jackals, feeding greedily on
the shoals of fish they drive before them, so
greedily indeed, that many of them were too
gorged and heavy to rise out of the water and
our way, but, after a helpless attempt, would
duck under only just in time. The flying fish
were more alert, and would rise away out of
the water, going many yards through the air
before dropping again into the sea, and
glittering with every rainbow colour in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>The coast scenery is not beautiful; it is too
bare and dry-looking, especially after passing
Santa Barbara, but the glamour of the southern
sun is over everything, and gives all a caressing
smile, at any rate, from a distance. It was a
delight to see these wonderful effects again,
and we felt glad to be once more in the warm
sunshine.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the bay of San Miguel
late in the afternoon of the fourth day, it
looked so radiantly beautiful in the soft glow
of the setting sun, as if it might indeed be the
gate into a real land of promise; a land
flowing with milk and honey.</p>

<p>It is a splendid bay, and the position of the
town is quite ideal, and though the most has
not been made of its possibilities, many
improvements are going on steadily. Given
money and taste, it should be one of the most
lovely places in the world.</p>

<p>We found comfortable rooms in a boarding-house,
and settled down to rest awhile from
searching and questioning. The boys went
to school as in San Francisco. These free
State schools are exceedingly good. The
teachers are among the most charming ladies
we have met, and the plan of using the same
books, and the same system of teaching all
over the State, saves much loss of time, since
a child coming to a new school can at once be
placed in exactly the same position where he
left off, in his former school, some three
hundred miles away.</p>

<p>But in spite of our determination to let
ourselves drift for a time, we were very soon
drawn into the same old probing and exploring,
more especially as we were delighted
with the climate of San Miguel. On the
strength of this, and because our English
hearts were hungering for some place more
homelike than any boarding-house can ever
be, we took a little house, hired the necessary
furniture, and began our first experiences of
Chinamen as general servants.</p>

<p>We had the most wonderful procession of
Celestials through the little kitchen before we
left that wee house. There was no room
convenient for the Chinaman's bedroom,
without giving him one close to our own,
which was not to be thought of, so the
arrangement was, that when supper was over,
and the work done, he should retire to
Chinatown, coming back in good time in the
morning to get breakfast and do his other
duties. He seemed quite pleased with this
plan, and we got along swimmingly for a
fortnight. Then he dropped the news casually
to me that he was going to Los Angeles the
next day. When I exclaimed at the shortness
of the notice, he beamed all over, and said, "Me
bling other boy, him allie lightie, him stay."</p>

<p>Before I had quite made up my mind what
to do, I heard breathless jabbering in the
kitchen, and on going in there, was introduced
by Sing Lee to Quong Wong, our new cook.
Both of them were very friendly and smiling.
No. 1 was showing No. 2 where everything
was kept, and giving him what sounded like
most eloquent instructions about his duties,
both of them being very grave and business-like
over this. I did not seem to be needed,
and so quietly went back to the sitting-room.
Supper was prepared and cooked by the two
together to an unending accompaniment of
Chinese chatter.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the procession.
Some men stayed a week, others three weeks
or a month, and each brought and carefully
installed his successor, I taking no part whatever,
except to learn a new Chinese name.
We had tall fat fellows, tall lean ones, little
dumpy ones and spare wiry ones; all of them
clever and quick beyond anything I had ever
seen or known. They keep themselves exquisitely
neat, in their white linen coats and
aprons, which seem always to remain spotless.
Their hands are perfectly fascinating; such
delicate tapering fingers, and such a masterly
way of touching everything. One member of
the profession, I remember, who had the most
dainty taper fingers, was very fond of music,
and, seeing that I was interested, sat down
very simply at my Broadwood grand (the only
piece of furniture which we had brought from
Frisco) and played some hymns quite nicely.
He used to sing, too, at his work&mdash;all day&mdash;in
a curious high falsetto, of which he seemed
very proud. He had learnt to play the piano
at the mission schools, where many of them
go, and are converted&mdash;so they say. But they
find the free lessons in English, which are
given there, so cheap and convenient, that
their motives in being converted are rather
mixed. When he left me, it was to go the
very next day to San Francisco on most
important business, so he said. That, of
course, was only the usual way of giving
notice, and did not prevent his greeting me
smilingly whenever I chanced to meet him in
the streets of San Miguel. He came to the
rescue also, when, through some hitch, the
chain of succession was broken, and I was left
to struggle alone in my little kitchen, and he
stayed with me till he could find another
"boy." I began to be haunted by a story I
had heard often repeated. A certain lady
was much puzzled and distressed because she
could never keep any Chinaman beyond a few
days; they would arrive, smiling and seemingly
much pleased with everything, but invariably
on the third or fourth day they would insist
upon leaving at once. At last, in despair,
the poor mistress persuaded her Chinaman to
explain the mystery to her, before he had
carried himself and his bundle away.</p>

<p>He led her to a dark corner of the kitchen,
and showed her some Chinese writing high up
on the wall, which be interpreted, "too much
talkee here." That was all. But it had been
enough to upset all the comfort of the
household.</p>

<p>Probably after that she took the hint and
let her Chinaman do the work in his own way,
with as few words or instructions from her as
possible. They are so marvellously clever in
taking up the work of a new place the very
moment they arrive, exactly as though they
had been always in this one house only, that
it is no wonder they resent any interference;
and the sooner one learns to leave them
entirely to themselves, the sooner one reaches
some kind of peace.</p>

<p>However, I found to my relief, that no
secret sign had gone out against myself or the
house; the difficulty was the long daily walk
to Chinatown. With their small feet and
uncomfortable shoes, they are all bad walkers,
and each in turn had tired of the effort, and
handed the place over to a friend. This
explanation, kindly given me by Mr. Kee
Mane, who kept the Chinese stores, lifted a
weight from my mind, and I resigned myself to
continuing my lessons in fresh Chinese names.</p>

<p class='ph3'>THE PERSEVERING SPIDER.</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/i_201b.jpg" width="200" height="236" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Can</span> any pleasant moral lesson be learned
from the spider? I fancy some of our readers
asking&mdash;the spider, whom many regard as the
most treacherous, cruel, and unrelenting of
those creatures who lie in wait for prey? By
the song "Will you walk into my parlour?
said the spider to the fly," in the nursery,
several generations of children have been
early prejudiced against this useful and most
intelligent insect.</p>

<p>When they are a little older, it is true,
the spider is held up to them as a wonderful
example of perseverance in that story
of King Robert the Bruce, who, when he
was banished from his country, lying in concealment
in a miserable hovel, and considering
whether it would not be well to give up
the struggle to secure his own, and with it
restore freedom to his country, was attracted
by the sight of a spider hanging at the end of
a thread and trying to swing from one part of
the cabin roof to another in order there to fix
its line. Six times whilst the King watched
it attempted to do this and failed. The
Bruce remembered then that he also had
made just six attempts&mdash;that is, fought six
battles with his enemies, and without success.
"Now," thought he, "if that spider tries a
seventh time and succeeds, I will take it as a
good omen for myself, and will also try my
fortune a seventh time." The spider reached
the beam, and Bruce went forth to victory
after victory.</p>

<p>The disgust aroused by the spider is by no
means a just one, and the fear some people
have of these insects is most unreasonable and
absurd. In tropical countries the bites of
some are dangerous, but not nearly so much
so as is supposed. Our own spiders are
harmless enough. I never destroy the webs
they make in my garden, the circular nets
which they stretch from one branch to
another, which are considered by experts to
show a perfection of weaving, whilst those
webs which are woven in odd corners of our
dwellings reveal an intelligence in their
arrangement which is perfectly marvellous. I
heard a clever man say lately that spiders
were the greatest engineers in the world.</p>

<p>In some corner of your room you may
study the horizontal net, covered with dust,
perhaps, which is the base of the structure.
Irregularly-crossed threads above this
cause the prey to become entangled, and its
end is inevitable. Most ingenious is the den
in which the hunter is hidden in waiting.
It consists of a circular tunnel with a double
outlet. One of these, being horizontal, opens
on to the web. The other is vertical, with
a passage below, which serves as a trapdoor,
whilst from the former the spider darts out
on his prey. As soon as a fly has been
destroyed&mdash;its blood sucked&mdash;it is seized by
its captor and dragged to the tunnel to be
thrown out at the trapdoor. This is no
doubt lest the <i>dbris</i> should alarm other flies.
The hunter can also escape itself, when
necessary, by this exit. This does not often
happen, perhaps, and the main use of the
trapdoor, says M. Pouchet, an interesting
French naturalist, is to get rid of the remains
of the spider's repasts.</p>

<p>"The poison apparatus of spiders," says
the same author, "is precisely analogous to
that of serpents, only it is of microscopic size.
It possesses mobile teeth, hollow fangs which
distil the poison into the wound, and this is
secreted by a peculiar gland situated in the
interior of the palpi attached to the under
jaws which effect the bite. In the large
tropical species this lethal fluid is so active
that it kills in an instant animals of a far
superior size, and is often employed against
the birds which the spiders seize on the
trees." The so-called Bird-eating Spider
attacks the lovely humming-birds. It is
called the Great Spider in South America,
and its cocoon is three inches long and one
broad.</p>

<p>Thinking of the creatures of prey and their
quarry is always a painful subject. Yet we
know surely that the all-wise Creator would
not order the balance of nature to be kept up
in this way if it involved cruelty. There is
cruelty in some of the methods of vivisection&mdash;in
the horrible way, for instance, in which
one French scientist at least has studied and
tested by torture how far a poor loving
mother dog will bear being maimed, before it
can be induced to leave its offspring. And
there is a brutality, as demoralising to the men
who have to carry out their master's orders in
felling oxen for the market, as it is torturing to
the poor beasts. Nature's methods of killing
are, as a rule, mercifully rapid. It seems to
be a part of the Creator's plan that some of
His creatures should live on the rest, and
"some," says a thoughtful writer on God's
providence, "have suggested that such a
state of things implies a reflection upon the
Divine goodness, ... but by the means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
now specified some classes of animals are held
in check which would otherwise so multiply as
to become an intolerable nuisance."</p>

<p>And so we consider with complacence the
fact that the cat kills the mouse, the owl
catches up the field vole and the beetle; the
swallow rids the air of insect pests which
would render life intolerable, the ladybird
lives on the aphides that devour our plants&mdash;those
fat green insects which destroy our
roses and honeysuckle.</p>

<p>The spider does his own appointed work in
a way which shows astute intelligence. Death
is the common lot, and most of the creatures
preyed on pass swiftly away in the full height
of enjoyment without lingering sickness or
decay. I have known a spider's web put
to a very odd purpose by a lady I knew
well in New Zealand, a very successful
poultry rearer. When her chickens had "the
pip," she declared that she cured them by a
buttered pill consisting of spiders' webs. And
I have known also Chinamen give dying men,
as a last remedy, a tiny chicken pounded up in
a mortar, bones, feathers, and all, and welded
into a huge pill. They declared that it often
cured when all else had failed. But this is a
digression.</p>

<p>To return to our spiders. Besides the geometric
spiders (<i>sic</i>) we have the gossamer
spiders, little creatures that make floating
webs in the air and on the ground in the
autumn. These avail themselves cleverly of
the currents of air in attaching their lines,
raising their arms to test the direction of the
light winds. Her webs are often destroyed
by rain or wind, or broken by some large
creature like a bee or a wasp getting entangled
in one; but the patient worker is not
so discouraged as to give up. She patiently
fasts, until the damage is repaired. And
spiders seem to be weather prophets, for it
has been stated that when it threatens to
become wet and stormy, the outdoor spider
will make the threads which support its net
short, but if they expect finer, settled weather,
these will be long. As is the case with ants,
some species are more provident than others,
and one has been described which suspended
its prey in the meshes above and below the
centre of the net, having quite a well-stocked
larder. In the Fen countries a raft of a ball
of weeds, held together by slight silken
threads or cords, is often observed, on which
the spider floats down a stream in quest of
drowning insects.</p>

<p>The "Mason Spider's" home consists of a
hole several inches deep in the ground, and
perfectly cylindrical. It is lined with hangings.
The one nearest the rough sides is thick, and
carelessly woven. Over this, like a skilful
decorator, he places a hanging of fine silk,
carefully wrought. The door or lid of this
dwelling is furnished with a cushion of silk
inside, whilst above it is made of the same
material as the soil, so that when the master
is at home there is nothing to reveal that fact,
his door being closed. Layers of earth and
silk compose the lid.</p>

<p>Kate Dalrymple, as the old Scottish ballad
tells us, was "Aye eident and thrifty."
Eident is a rare word, expressive of great
perseverance and application. "To be called
eident and thrifty" was the greatest commendation
to the good graces of the desired
mother-in-law. I am not sure, however,
apart from this, that it is always a very
desirable thing to be coveted as a wished-for
daughter-in-law. A very shrewd friend of
mine, a witty Scotchwoman, when young
was told that the mother of one of her suitors
was very anxious that she should marry him.
"'Deed," said the girl, "I'd sooner marry a
man whose mother was not so anxious to get
him married." And she was quite right.</p>

<p>But to be persevering as well as brave, and
to be gifted with physical energy and endurance,
is a rare endowment for any woman. Mrs.
Scott Gatty, in one of her stories, tells
of a preacher who used to say, "Girls, be
brave; boys, be pure." I used to hear this
story many years before, as a child. It was
told then of an old superintendent of a Sunday-school.
He would say, "Boys, they bid you
be brave and girls be pure; but I say, Girls
be brave and boys be pure." Then the world
would be far on in a better way than it is
now.</p>

<p>"The spider taketh hold with her hands,
and is in kings' palaces," says the wise man in
Proverbs xxx. 28. What a picture in a few
simple words of the industry, courage and
perseverance with which this little creature is
gifted! and of the reward which would seem
to be implied. Shall we seem to be straining
the image if we allow our thoughts to be
carried by this picture to the home of our
heavenly King, where, as we are promised,
our eyes shall see Him "in His beauty"? "To
patient faith," says the hymn, "the prize is
sure."</p>

<p>The spider, we might say, is essentially
of an aspiring nature. She weaves her net
high up in corners where the duster and broom
of the busy housemaid will not easily reach
her. She fasts long and is not drawn away
from the spot where she expects to get the
reward of her patience. Many of us can
work hard and well by fits and starts, but we
weary of sustained effort, and we are "found
sleeping." Or like the pilgrims to the Celestial
City we are tempted to stray and delight ourselves
in flowery "Bypath meadows." Play,
healthy recreation, we must have, but it must
be such as helps us in the race of life and
not such as weakens our purpose and hinders
us from reaching the desired goal. I look
back sometimes on the companions of my
girlhood, and I must often acknowledge that
certain boys and girls whom we were wont to
reproach as being dull plodders, have beaten
many of their fellows in the battle of life.</p>

<p>There is a species of spider which carries,
attached to her body, a round, white, silky bag
of eggs, just about as big as a pea. It is
heavy, but nothing would induce the affectionate
mother to part with it. The French
naturalist, Bonnet, in order to test this love
for her offspring, once threw such a mother
spider into the hole of an ant-lion, in the sand
where the great insect lay in hiding for its
prey. The poor spider tried to run away but
the ant-lion caught at the bag of eggs and
tried to drag it under the sand. At last he
succeeded in breaking the gluten by which her
bag was attached to her. Instantly the spider
seized this in her jaws and she struggled hard
to bear it away. It was in vain however; her
precious burden was dragged under. Then
the poor mother might have escaped with her
own life, but she preferred death to the loss
of her offspring, and if the naturalist had not
taken her out of the pit she would have been
buried with them. She would not leave the
spot however, although Bonnet tried to make
her do so, by moving her with a little twig,
over and over again. In reading this one
cannot help wishing that she had not been so
tortured. Some of our scientists, as I said
before, have pushed their studies of moral
qualities in the so-called brute world to a most
unjustifiable extent, it would seem.</p>

<p>When the young of this affectionate mother
are hatched, and they have got out of the bag
where they were kept so safely, they attach
themselves to her body. She carries them
everywhere she goes and feeds them until
they are able to fend for themselves.</p>

<p>Referring to persevering industry, we recall
the pretty story of William Cobbett's courtship
and marriage, as told by Dr. Smiles,
from his "Life." Cobbett was a practical man,
full of blunt common sense. When he first
saw the girl who afterwards became his wife,
she was only thirteen years of age, he being
twenty-one, and at the time sergeant-major in
a foot regiment stationed at St. John's in New
Brunswick. Passing her father's door, on a
cold winter's day, he saw the girl out in the
snow, scrubbing a washing-tub. "That's the
girl for me!" he cried, mentally, and he set
about making her acquaintance. As soon as
he could get discharged from the army, he
determined that he would persuade her to
become his wife. The girl returned to
Woolwich with her father, who was also a
sergeant-major, but in the artillery. The
night before they left St. John's, her lover
sent her a hundred and fifty guineas which he
had saved, begging her to accept it, so that
she might not be obliged to do any hard
work until he also could return to England
and marry her. She took the money, and it
was five years before Cobbett obtained his
discharge and was able to go to see the girl
he loved. "I found," he said, "my little
girl a servant of all work&mdash;and hard work it
was&mdash;at five pounds a year, in the house of
a Captain Brisac; and, without hardly saying
a word about the matter, she put into my
hands the whole of my hundred and fifty
guineas unbroken." Soon afterwards they
were married, and he delighted later in attributing
to her "the comfort and much of
the success of his after life." In his
"Advice to young men" he drew from his
wife his picture of a true and womanly helpmate,
with "a vividness and brightness and,
at the same time, a force of good sense that
have never been surpassed by any English
writer."</p>

<p>What Sarah Martin, who was left an orphan
very young, and who as a woman went out
dressmaking first at one shilling a day, was
able to achieve in visiting and helping to
reclaim poor prison women, and not only them
but dissolute men and boys, loving, praying,
and watching by them, you ought all to read
fully. I think the story of her life was
published by the Religious Tract Society.
She gave six and seven hours to this work
every day. For twenty years she did this
without help or reward&mdash;her grandmother
having left her ten or twelve pounds a year;
the rest of her income coming from her
hard work during part of each day as a dressmaker.
At last the gaol committee told her
that she must become their paid servant at
twelve pounds a year or "be excluded from
the prison." Although she shrank from this
payment of her labours of love, she had to
accept it, or give up her charge, and for two
years she had that poor stipend until her
health failed. She was in point of fact
schoolmistress and chaplain and seamstress to
the scum of Yarmouth. But what a reward
was hers!</p>

his cool ones he made that resolution good."
We cannot all be active scientists or philanthropists,
but let us end this little study by
resolving that we will be less discouraged and
hindered by difficulties in our own special
work, or by the consideration of what we are
apt to deem our unfitness for the appointed
task, our own inadequacy, than we have
hitherto been.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Roy</span>
did not soon lose
sight of those words
of Ivor&mdash;"Why,
Roy, don't you
know that you are
the one bit of cheer
left to us?"</p>

<p>He had not perhaps
hitherto been
more disposed to
put himself into the
place of another
than most boys of
thirteen; but the
events of the last
few months had tended to make him
thoughtful; and close intercourse with
Ivor could hardly fail to pull him mentally
upwards.</p>

<p>Denham was not only considerably
better educated and better read than
the average young officer of his day&mdash;a
matter for congratulation in respect
of Roy's present education&mdash;but also
his intellectual gifts were well above
the average level. The main force of
the man lay, however, rather in the
direction of character than of pure
intellect. There was about him a
soldierly directness and simplicity, and
a thoroughness which often belongs
to that type of nature. Whatever
might befall, he would do his duty, not
only with no thought of consequences to
himself, but in the most direct and
complete mode possible.</p>

<p>He was a good man as well as a
most gallant soldier, and that in the
best sense of the word. He was one
who might say little, but who would at
all costs do what he believed to be
right. He was honourable, true, pure-minded,
chivalrous towards women,
tender towards little children, reverent
and faithful towards his God. He was
indomitable in courage, when he faced
a foe; but so soon as fighting ceased
he would be the first to succour a
wounded enemy. All this means
largely, as has been earlier stated, that
Denham Ivor had taken shape under
the influence and the example of John
Moore. Ivor was the pupil, Moore the
master.</p>

<p>The prolonged banishment from England
and captivity in France were a
terrible trial to him; not only because
he was cut off indefinitely from the girl
whom he loved with whole-hearted devotion,
but because also he was cut off
in his young full vigour from every hope
of promotion and honour, and debarred
from serving under the Commander
whom he loved with a devotion no less
whole-hearted. Yet he seldom spoke
about the greatness of the trouble. It
seemed as if his spirit of soldierly
obedience had taught him submission to
the Divine Will.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that a friendship of
this kind could not fail to be good for
Roy. And the friendship was not such
in name only, for there were advantages
on both sides. Much as Ivor could do
for the lad, in the way of teaching him
and keeping him out of mischief, there
was an opposite view of the matter.
Roy, by his light-heartedness and his
spirit of unconquerable fun, could and
did do much to lighten the weight of
the young Guardsman's wearisome
captivity.</p>

<p>Thus far Roy had done it, not knowing.
Now the fact had dawned upon him, as
a novel idea, that he might be some little
help to Ivor. He was delighted; yet
almost immediately he found the task
less easy than when he had carried it
out unconsciously.</p>

<p>The journey from Fontainebleau to
Verdun, a matter of one hundred and
seventy miles or more, would be no great
matter in these days of steam-power,
but it was a considerable matter in those
times of slow travelling. It seemed to
weigh upon Ivor's spirits more than
anything had yet weighed upon them;
or Denham was less successful in hiding
what he really felt. Mrs. Baron was
brighter than for months past; her relief
at not being forced to leave her
husband or to part yet with Roy tending
to cheerfulness; and Colonel Baron,
glad to see her happy, was the same
himself. Roy as usual was in good
spirits. Ivor alone appeared to have
parted with his elasticity. He did not
give in to the mood of depression, but it
was patent enough to Mrs. Baron,
whose concerned gaze wandered often
in his direction.</p>

<p>No one except Ivor himself could know
the haunting vision of Polly Keene,
which floated before his eyes, through
all those miles of driving, driving, ever
farther away from where he craved to be.
He might respond readily to Roy's
chatter; but so soon as silence recurred,
up again would come that picture of
Polly, with her soft velvet eyes, her
delicate colouring, her arch smile. And
then he would hear the tender yielding
in her voice, as she confessed that she
did like Captain Ivor&mdash;well, just a little!
and that she might perhaps be willing
to marry him&mdash;well, some day!</p>

<p>Out of this Denham would awake to
the dreary flat of the surrounding
country, in its wintry colouring; and
the wonder would suggest itself&mdash;how
many years might not creep slowly by
before that could ever be? He might
even grow old and grey in this miserable
banishment before he should see
Polly again. Why not?</p>

<p>In those times wars had been wont to
last in one unbroken stretch, for such
periods as seven years, ten years,
twenty years, thirty years.</p>

<p>Would Polly be content to wait for
him?</p>

<p>This question took him by surprise
one day, with nothing especial to call it
forth. Ivor had not before so much as
thought of the reverse possibility. The
idea that she might <i>not</i> be willing to
wait came freshly; but having once
come, it did not soon depart.</p>

<p>He never afterwards lost the impression
of that moment. The scene around
was deeply stamped upon his mind, in
connection with the one thought.</p>

<p>They had just reached the end of a
stage, and were entering a small town,
where fresh horses would be in waiting.
Ivor was listening to Roy, responding
in a half-absent fashion, and gazing
down the street, when, without prelude or
warning, that query burst upon him.</p>

<p>Would Polly indeed be willing to
wait? Did she care enough? She was
very young; hardly more than a child
in age. If he were to be years away
from her, the two never meeting, letters
seldom passing between them, could he
expect&mdash;would it even be fair and
reasonable to expect&mdash;that he should remain
enshrined in her heart, as surely
as she would remain enshrined in his?
Polly had known him intimately but a
few weeks, though their acquaintance
extended farther back; and impressions
made upon the mind and imagination
at seventeen are not always deep or
lasting. Moreover, Polly was exceedingly
pretty, quite unusually charming.
Other men would wish to marry her.
Could he expect such constancy on her
part, as to wait through long years for her
absent lover, refusing every other chance
that might present itself? What would
her grandmother think and say? Polly,
with all her charms, was a portionless
maiden.</p>

<p>The whole question rolled itself out
before Denham's mental gaze, as they
drove along the chief street of the
place, exciting less attention than commonly
on such occasions. With his
bodily eyes he saw little, yet in a manner
he was aware that a considerable stir
prevailed, and he heard, almost without
hearing, Roy's rapid questions.</p>

<p>"I don't in the least know," he replied
mechanically, as they came to a
halt before the inn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span></p>

<p>"Den, look! What a lot of people
outside the <i>maison de ville</i>! What's
it all about? And don't some of
them look miserable? What are they
after?"</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest idea. Something
seems to be wrong. Easy to find
out."</p>

<p>The mystery was soon explained. This
happened to be a day appointed for drawing
for the conscription; and around the
door of the little town hall opposite were
gathered the near relatives of the young
fellows who were eligible. There was
no mistaking the dread written upon
their faces.</p>

<p>One woman in particular drew notice.
She was bent and old in appearance,
with grey hair, though very likely not
beyond middle age; and she wore a
short, very full skirt, with a long-waisted
bodice, and big brass buckles on her
shoes. From under the wide-brimmed
hat her face waited with a consuming
eagerness for news, the lips working,
the eyes staring.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she's got a son. I hope,
if she has, he won't be taken," exclaimed
Roy. "What are they doing
inside?"</p>

<p>"Drawing lots, to see who must go to
the wars. All the young men in the
neighbourhood, of a certain age, have
been called together, probably; and
then those who are passed by surgeons
as whole and healthy are made to draw
lots. Some will escape, and some will
have to go."</p>

<p>"O look&mdash;they are coming out.
And something is being said&mdash;what
is it?"</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;the names of those who are
drawn."</p>

<p>All listened intently; and the elderly
woman, clasping her worn hands, leant
forward, with a face of concentrated
suspense.</p>

<p>"Jean Paulet&mdash;&mdash;" sounded clearly.</p>

<p>A bitter wailing cry burst from her,
drowning what followed.</p>

<p>She held out wild appealing arms.
"Mon fils! Mon fils!" she gasped,
and dropped senseless to the ground.</p>

<p>"Can nothing be done?" exclaimed
Mrs. Baron, in distress. "The poor
creature! George, will they not let him
off? Surely they need not be so cruel
as to take him away!"</p>

<p>"I am afraid the only chance would
be a substitute&mdash;and not much hope of
that."</p>

<p>"Do ask. Find out something. Do,
please."</p>

<p>Denham crossed the road with his
rapid stride, followed closely by his
shadow, Roy, while the Colonel came
after in more leisurely style. The poor
woman's friends were attending to her,
and Ivor, always the Colonel's spokesman
in a foreign language, made inquiries
of a respectable man, perhaps
a small shopkeeper, standing by. The
man shrugged his shoulders as he replied.
It had to be, he said, not unkindly
but resignedly. All young men
equally were subject to the conscription,
and he who "fell" had to go. There
was no escape, no remedy. None, except
through the purchase of a substitute,
and Marie Paulet, he feared, could not
manage that. She was a good woman,
truly estimable, and he was sorry for
her, yes, sincerely sorry; but what was
to be done? The First Consul required
soldiers, and, in fact, he would
have them! Another expressive shrug.</p>

<p>How much would be required for a
substitute? <i>Eh bien</i>&mdash;one hundred
livres would doubtless suffice. Mme.
Paulet, foreseeing this day, had toiled
hard and saved assiduously during
many years; but with her utmost
exertions, as he knew, for she had told
him, she had managed to get together
only fifty-five livres. No substitute
could be obtained for only fifty-five
livres. No, no, impossible! Jean would
have to go, and his mother would grow
used to it, like other mothers. How
soon? <i>Sans doute</i> he would be marched
away at once&mdash;immediately&mdash;to the
nearest dept, there to be exercised.
The thing had to be. There was no
remedy. All France was giving up her
best men, by tens of thousands, to feed
the Army. In parts already none but
women and old men remained to till the
soil.</p>

<p>Was Mme. Paulet a widow? asked
Denham.</p>

<p>"Oui, oui, oui, oui," the man said,
fast as the words could come. Certainly
she was a widow; but then she
was not over sixty, nor was Jean her
only son. Had she been over sixty, and
depending for her subsistence upon an
only son, then <i>vraiment</i> her case would
have been easily pleaded. Marie Paulet
was under fifty in age, though she
looked more, since she had toiled hard
and had known much sorrow. She had
a second son too, young and somewhat
lame, but able to work, though in truth
more of a burden than an assistance.
Jean, however, would have to go. This
was a supplementary conscription for
the year, more men being urgently required
by the First Consul.</p>

<p>Jean Paulet stood with a face of
sullen despair beside his mother, saying
not a word. He was scarcely over
nineteen, only one fortnight past the
day, Ivor's informant remarked; and
he looked young, being loose-limbed and
shambling, though broad-shouldered.</p>

<p>"Ask them how much they could
make up among themselves towards
the purchase of a substitute. Some
may be willing to help."</p>

<p>Denham obeyed, and a discussion
took place in raised voices. The two
Englishmen waited gravely, Mrs. Baron
watching affairs from the coach, while
Roy stood close by, scanning the conscript
with interested gaze. Marie
Paulet sat upon the cold ground, weeping
bitterly.</p>

<p>"About fifteen livres seems to be the
outside, sir. They are poor here. It is
a marvel how the woman has managed
to save so much. But I am ready to
give fifteen livres."</p>

<p>Colonel Baron's eyebrows stirred.
"More than you can afford, I should
have imagined, but you know your own
business best. Well, tell them that if
they can find a substitute for one hundred
livres, you will give that, and I will
give another fifteen. Of course, we
can't wait now to see the end of the
affair. Tell them we promise it on the
word of an English gentleman&mdash;that's
understood everywhere. Give our Verdun
address to the Cur yonder&mdash;he
looks an honest man. For my part, I
doubt if a substitute can be procured,
the drain on the country has been so
severe of late. But they may succeed.
Anyhow, it will soften matters a little
to the poor woman. One rather grudges
letting the money go into French
pockets, but I defy anyone with proper
sensibilities to stand out against that
poor creature's misery."</p>

<p>Denham listened with his air of half-military,
half-courtly, attention to this
somewhat prolonged exposition of the
Colonel's views. Then he explained
what "Monsieur le Colonel Anglais"
had said, failing to make clear his own
share in the matter, though from no
lack of power to express himself. The
scene that followed was eminently French
in its <i>abandon</i> of joy. One of the
young men present, who was eligible
but who had not been drawn&mdash;had not
<i>tomb</i>, as the saying was&mdash;came forward,
and offered for the sum of one
hundred livres to go as the substitute
for Jean Paulet. This settled matters;
and without hesitation Colonel Baron
produced notes for the amount he had
named, Denham adding his own donation
with a rapid movement, which drew
no attention.</p>

<p>Whereupon enthusiasm rose to its
height. The people of the town, with
whom Marie and her son were plainly
favourites, shouted their approval;
while Marie crept close to Colonel
Baron, knelt at his feet, sobbed out her
wordless rapture, and even kissed his
hands, to the Colonel's discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I say, Den, I'm going back to the
carriage. Say whatever you choose to
them. It's all right, but I vow this sort
of thing doesn't quite suit a Britisher.
And it strikes me you haven't made 'em
understand that you're doing as much
as I am. Tell 'em that, and talk as
much as you think right, and then come
along."</p>

<p>A murmur in French from Roy to
Jean Paulet gave the further explanation,
which would not have been forthcoming
from Denham; and he had to
submit to some of the vehement demonstrations
from which his Colonel had
basely fled. Denham endured them,
with a certain reticent indifference of
manner, which did not mean true indifference.
A slightly quizzical smile
stirred his lips, but the dark eyes, bent
upon poor old Mme. Paulet, were infinitely
kind.</p>

<p>Then he too made a move towards the
coach; and Roy, lingering one moment
more, held out a hand to Jean, who
seemed half stunned with his unexpected
escape.</p>

<p>"Bon jour, monsieur," the boy said
frankly. "I'm glad you are not going
to fight against the English just yet."</p>

<p>Jean muttered broken words&mdash;something
of a faltering hope and prayer that
a day might come when he should have
it in his power, perhaps&mdash;who could
tell?&mdash;to do some benefit for Monsieur
le Colonel, or for Monsieur le Colonel's
friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed very unlikely&mdash;most unlikely&mdash;that
he and these passing
English prisoners should ever meet
again, still more that he should be
able to do aught for them. Yet most
improbable events do take place in this
world of ours. Roy had not that day
seen the last of Jean Paulet.</p>

<p>As the coach started, in the midst of
grateful acclamations, Marie Paulet
held up mute hands, tears streaming
down her faded cheeks. Such a look
was hers, that even Colonel Baron was
conscious of moisture in the region of
his eyes, though by no means easily
moved to outward emotion. Mrs. Baron
was weeping outright, with the thought
of what such a parting would be between
Roy and herself. As for Denham&mdash;nobody
managed to get a clear
sight of his face for a quarter of a
minute.</p>

<p>Then once more they were rolling
along the interminable roads, Roy declaiming
with boyish vehemence against
Napoleon, and wondering whether
Jean Paulet would ever again be drawn,
and would have after all to go. They
found a good deal to say on the
question, and for a while the interest of
the subject kept them going.</p>

<p>But Denham's mind, like a spring
slowly released, went back before long
to the one engrossing question, which
for a space had been thrust into the
background. Would Polly indeed wait
for him&mdash;no matter how long his imprisonment
might last? Or would she
grow tired of waiting, forget his love
and some day become the wife of
another?</p>

<p>He could not look that possibility in
the face with any sort of inward composure.
It held him in thrall, both day
and night, through the remainder of this
wearisome journey.</p>

<p>Roy was perplexed, during the last
two or three days of their progress
towards Verdun, at Ivor's absorption of
mind. For the first time in his experience,
his remarks failed repeatedly
to reach the other's understanding. So
new a phase of matters was bewildering.
Not, however, till they were
within three hours of Verdun did he
note his friend's face with sufficient
care to exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Den, I do believe you're
tired! Are you?"</p>

<p>"Been a dull companion to-day&mdash;have
I?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;but, Den!" Roy spoke in
accents of amazement. "You never
used to be anything of that sort! You
never usen't to have anything at all the
matter with you."</p>

<p>"Didn't I? All right&mdash;what do you
want me to look at now?"</p>

<p>"Is it because you're a prisoner?
Do you know, I couldn't get to sleep
last night for ever so long&mdash;not till past
eleven&mdash;thinking about it all. I say&mdash;don't
you hate old Boney? I do. He
makes everybody unhappy. Just think
of that poor Marie and her son; if you
and papa hadn't been there, she would
have lost Jean, and perhaps she'd never
have seen him again. Wasn't it horrid?
And I don't see how men can fight
properly, when they don't want to fight
at all. Our soldiers fight, because they
choose, not because they're made to
whether they want it or not. I'm sure
Jean didn't want to be a soldier, or he
wouldn't have been so glad to get off."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron leant across to say softly,
"Roy, do leave Denham in peace for a
little while."</p>

<p class='center p2'>"<span class="smcap">Willie only took a Horse.</span>"</p>

<p>Horse-stealers in our time are a good deal
handicapped by a change that has come over
public opinion. The Government used to
hang them, but the populace were by no
means horrified at the crime.</p>

<p>Here is a story indicating considerable
former leniency in popular thought. A horse-coper
"took" a horse and was discovered
and convicted, but owing to some assistance
he had given the police, he received a light
sentence.</p>

<p>He settled in a Norfolk village, turned an
honest stock-breeder, and prospered greatly;
but there was always a rumour that he had
been convicted of some sort of stealing.</p>

<p>A farmer's daughter, however, fell in love
with him and he asked her from her father.</p>

<p>"No," said the old yeoman; "I've nothing
against you, but no child of mine shall wed a
man who has been in trouble for stealing."</p>

<p>The daughter cried and implored, and at
last sobbed out, "Willie only took a horse."</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed the farmer, "didn't ye
say so before! Here have I been treating a
respectable man as if he had been a thief!"</p>


<p class='center p2'><span class="smcap">The Dead Defunct.</span></p>

<p>A learned weaver, in stating his case before
the provost of Irvine in Ayrshire, in the days
when hand-loom weaving was a leading
industry in that town, having had occasion to
speak of a party who was dead, repeatedly
described him as the defunct.</p>

<p>Irritated by the iteration of a word which he
did not understand, the provost exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's the use o' talking so much about
this child you call the defunct? Cannot ye
bring the man here and let him speak for
himsel'?"</p>

<p>"The defunct's dead, my lord!" replied
the weaver.</p>

<p>"Oh, that alters the case," gravely observed
the wise provost.</p>


<p class='center p2'><span class="smcap">The Art of Conversation.</span></p>

<p>"Tell me," pleaded the artless maid,
"wherein lies the secret of the art of
conversation."</p>

<p>The sage struck the attitude he was wont
to assume when in the act of imparting wisdom
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My child, listen!"</p>

<p>"I am listening!" breathlessly she
answered.</p>

<p>"Well, my child," he rejoined, "that is all
there is in the art of conversation."</p>


<p class='center p2'><span class="smcap">How to be free from Discontent.</span></p>

<p>A philosopher offered sacrifice every day in
the temple of Jupiter and made always the
same prayer.</p>

<p>At last Jupiter grew tired of hearing over
and over again the one request and said,
"What would you have?"</p>

<p>"I crave to become a contented man,"
replied the philosopher. "Never yet have I
enjoyed a really peaceful day, for I have never
been entirely contented. Even now, aged as
I am, there is always something that I long
for."</p>

<p>"Consider well what you ask," said the
god sternly; "there is but one way in which
you can secure the boon you seek."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked the philosopher
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I must strike you dead; for in death only
can man be free from discontent."</p>

<p>"Upon consideration," replied the philosopher,
"I think I should be better contented
to remain discontented."</p>

<p>And so saying he put on his hat and hastily
withdrew from the temple.</p>

<p class='center p2'><span class="smcap">How she showed her Gratitude.</span></p>

<p>The present Bishop of Gibraltar, Dr. Sandford,
tells the following story. When a
young man, and a shy, very shy curate, he
called to see an old woman among his
parishioners, who complained to him that all
she had to live on was half-a-crown a week
which she received from the parish.</p>

<p>"And out of that, sir," she went on, "I
have to pay two shillings for rent, a shilling
for firing, sixpence for bread, fourpence
for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, stop, my good woman," said the
young curate, "you can't pay all that out of
half-a-crown."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but I do," she persisted, "I
pay&mdash;&mdash;" and she ran through her accounts
again.</p>

<p>Finding she was not to be convinced of her
arithmetical errors, and that she was both
poverty-stricken and deserving, Mr. Sandford
promised to send her an extra half-crown on
his own account each week.</p>

<p>"For this she rewarded me," says the
bishop, "by coming much more regularly to
church, but to my horror she never caught my
eye while I was in the reading desk or pulpit
without promptly jumping up and bobbing me
a little curtsey to show her gratitude. Imagine
my feelings as a shy young curate."</p>


<p class='p2'><span class="smcap">How The Ducks were Taught.</span>&mdash;An
officer in the British navy tells us that on one
of his voyages, he saw a Chinaman, who kept
ducks for a living, practise an odd piece of
ingenuity. In the daytime the ducks were
permitted to float about on the river, but at
nightfall they were carefully collected. The
keeper, when it began to grow dark, gave
a whistle, when the ducks always flew towards
him with violent speed, so they were all
invariably safe at home in less than a minute.
How do you suppose he had educated his
flock so effectually? He always beat the last
duck.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">This</span> well-known
magazine of
ours, the
dear old
"G. O. P.,"
is read wherever
in this
wide world the
English language is
understood, and it
is this very fact that
puzzles and worries me a good
deal when I am commencing to
write a paper for my readers. You
see it is like this: things I may say, and
advice I may give, may not suit everyone, as
the "G. O. P." finds its way into cottage
as well as mansion-house. I have seen its
welcome face while travelling in my caravan,
in many a stately home in England and in
many a feudal castle in bonnie Scotland; and
I know too it is read by the farmer's fireside
in this country and by the ingle-side in the
far north, when the snow-wind goes howthering
round the house and mourns in the
chimney like the sound of sea and wind on a
surf-beaten shore.</p>

<p>And I "dinna forget" either that I have
many thousands of lassies in the city, who
have but little time to open it till eventide or
even till Sunday itself.</p>

<p>Nor do I forget that the things I tell girls
at home here to do, may not altogether apply
to those in Australia or Africa. Never mind,
I try to do my best. Who can do more?</p>

<p>And now, first and foremost, I must wish
you all a very healthy New Year. This is
from my heart. Dinna forget that. For, if
you have health, you are bound to have
happiness, so long as shocks of grief and real
sorrow keep aloof. Even then, if you are
strong, you will be better able to withstand
these, than if you were chicken-hearted and
weakly.</p>

<p>There is one symptom of weakness, by the
way, that is often over-looked. A girl may
be as fresh and bonnie as a thistle or a rose,
yet if she is too sensitive and too sentimental
she cannot be really well. Over-sensitiveness
may be caused in a good many ways, but it is
very apt to lead on to hysteria, and this is a
very serious ailment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Not going to Repeat.</span></h3>

<p>I am not going to repeat to you all the
various rules of health I have already, in these
columns, laid down scores of times, for the
very best of dishes may be served up once
too often.</p>

<p>Just one thing, however, I must mention,
and you may consider me talking figuratively
or not, as you please.</p>

<p>I have a pet swift&mdash;the biggest kind of
swallow that visits this country&mdash;but, being a
pet, he never leaves me more than twelve
hours at a time, and in that brief space he
may have flown one thousand miles, and
perhaps visited the rooms of more than one
hundred of my girl readers. He can speak
various languages almost as well as Rougemont,
and a little nearer to the truth, and I
sit up to listen to him sometimes till long
past twelve at night.</p>

<p>Dinna forget to look out for my birdie.
He can see you when you little know of
it. But one thing which he has recently
told me is that a very large number of you
have given up your bath, to which I fondly
fancied I had inured you. This vexed me
a deal; but you will promise to begin it
again very soon, won't you? It is the
greatest invigorator of the muscles and nervous
system in the world. So "dinna
forget."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Colds and Coughs.</span></h3>

<p>Dinna forget that colds and coughs are
rampant about this time of the year. I am
writing these lines long before Christmas, and
I have been prophesying for England an open
winter. But dinna forget that a green Yule
makes a fat kirkyard, and colds are more
easily caught from the green cold earth and
the damp cold winds than even from frost and
snow. The more you are out-of-doors in
snow-time&mdash;which ought to be glow-time&mdash;the
better you will be, provided you are not
too warmly and heavily clad and do not wear
india-rubber clothing in any shape or form.</p>

<p>When a cold comes on, take a warm drink
or posset of some kind at bed-time and eight
to ten grains of Dover's powder. Get thus a
good sweat and a good sleep. Then take an
aperient (apenta water) next morning, but I
advise you to remain in bed till eventide.
This is one of the best ways of cutting short a
cold that I know of.</p>

<p>But if coughing continues, you must see a
doctor. Coughs may be far more dangerous
than you think, and may lead to mischief.
Dinna forget that death respects neither
beauty nor sex. Indeed, it is often the
sweetest flowers of earth that leave us first.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Neuralgia.</span></h3>

<p>A great many young ladies from seven to
seventy complain about this terrible trouble
in some form or another. If it is what we
call hemi-crania, engaging, if I may use the
term, the whole half of the face and head, it
may proceed from a bad tooth, or from what
is the worst sort of a tooth anyone could be
plagued with&mdash;a tooth with one small hole in
the side. Have this seen to as soon as the
first attack has gone. Probably a clever
dentist may be able to fill it for you. Some
girls go hurrying away to the dentist at once,
have gas, and have it out. Such a pity, for
as you get older what a blessing you will find
your own teeth!</p>

<p>Thank Heaven, I have never worn a false
tooth, but it strikes me the sensation can be
far from agreeable. If one uses the toothbrush,
with a good disinfectant powder, such
as borax or charcoal, followed by a rinse of
water tinged red with permanganate of potash
(and this is usually sold as Condy's fluid), she
will have teeth that will last as long as they're
wanted.</p>

<p>But what I wish to tell you here is this:
apart from actual decay of a tooth and
consequent irritation of the nerve, a girl need
never have facial neuralgia, nor sciatica, nor
any other "algia" if she but lives in such a
way as to make herself hardy as a heather
stem. Dinna forget that.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Curatives.</span></h3>

<p>Dinna forget that medicines are, as a rule,
but palliative, and to call them curatives is, in
nine cases out of ten, a very great misnomer.
All doctors will tell you the same; but they
are exceedingly useful and even most necessary
at times. Only dinna forget that they do not
repair, nor rebuild the framework of our
bodies. Only good, well-chosen food can do
that. But, as it does not do to eat when you
are not hungry, because then the stomach and
other organs are too delicate to digest, you
must get up an appetite by exercise, recreation
and fresh air.</p>

<p>I don't want you to go about as if you were
an invalid. That will make you worse, and
your friends will pretend to pity you, and this
acting on your mind will soon make you an
invalid in earnest. No, keep up bravely and
do not complain. Fate will then say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no frightening that girl to
death! She doesn't scare worth sixpence.
Look at her now, on her bit of a bike, with
her lips like a half-cut cherry, and the rose
tint upon her cheek. Bah, I'll go and try to
frighten someone else!"</p>

<p>Then your nerves are re-strung, muscles get
hard, you grow a biceps, and every ache and
pain flies away to the Back o' Bell-Fuff.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">At this time of Year.</span></h3>

<p>At this time of year many girls whose
nerves are finely strung suffer from hypochondriasis,
or lowness of spirits, more especially
if the ground is soft and the sky grey and
ugly.</p>

<p>The real hypochondriac is more or less
verging on lunacy, because she has delusions.
Nothing seems to go right with her, nothing
ever will be right again. There is no beauty
anywhere in life, which, taken on the whole, is
a great big fraud. Why was she ever sent
into this world at all, at all, against her will?
She is sure she didn't wish to be born, and
she wishes she were well out of it. She is
sad, melancholy, abstracted, and does nothing
with any will.</p>

<p>Well, what shall we do with a girl of this
kind? What say you, mother? Medicine?
Was that what you suggested? Well,
medicine, even if she could swallow the whole
pharmacop&#339;ia, would do her no more good
than a pinch of snuff; in fact, not so much,
for the snuff would make her sneeze, and that
would help her for a time. She must have a
change.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A change, a change, and many a change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faces and footsteps and all things strange."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dinna forget that. If she cannot get away,
she must get a new fad of some kind. Only
there is one thing, mother, which pray dinna
forget. You must never let her think that
you think she is ill. You've got to draw her
away from her imaginary miseries, and all will
soon be well.</p>

<p>"What would you prescribe for my
daughter?" a lady once asked me. "She
must eat."</p>

<p>"Then let her have a Shetland pony," I
replied abstractedly.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"A Shetland pony, and a young one. Oh,
not to eat, to ride on, and make a general
favourite of. For a time the pony will
manage her; then with love and a tiny switch
she will learn to manage the pony. After
that the fun will begin, and her imaginary
troubles will all fly away."</p>

<p>In a month or two the cure was complete,
and I used to see the girl&mdash;she was young&mdash;careering
across the common, her bonnie
yellow hair and the pony's mane streaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
out in the wind and her face as merry as a
May morning.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Does Winter damage Beauty?</span></h3>

<p>It need not, if beauty is only looked well
after. But how shall it be? Not by powders
and paint, dear young readers&mdash;dinna forget
that. Leave rouge and the rest of it to
Miss So-and-so and all the other "quite old
things" whom you know. Be ye natural;
unless, indeed, you have some real blemish.
Dinna forgot you have youth on your side,
and youth and beauty are almost synonymous
terms. You like Miss So-and-so very well
indeed, and my swift has just told me she
heard you make the following remark the
other day to a companion&mdash;</p>

<p>"Know Miss S.? Oh, yes; have known
her for ages. Poor, dear, old thing, how
well she makes up!"</p>

<p>Well, hug the happiness you possess in being
young, to your heart of hearts; but a little
tinge of sadness must mar it at times, when
you remember that you too must get older
and be fain to assume the attractions you shall
then no longer possess.</p>

<p>But beauty in winter? Well, it must be
kept up, and can only be kept up by rational
means. If you expose yourself to high cold
winds while biking or driving, you may spoil
your complexion for weeks to come. I
declare I should hardly like to enter the
breakfast-room with such a cold as your own
folly has brought you, accompanied by watery
eyes that blink at the sunshine, and that
wicked, wee red nose. Well, exposure is
unnecessary, so we shall leave that alone.</p>

<p>Next comes ablution and clothing. If you
care a French penny for the beauty you
possess, you will be careful as to both. If you
won't, can't or sha'n't take your bath, dinna
forget to have very frequent changes of
underclothing. But in some form or other
thorough ablution is imperative.</p>

<p>Food comes next. Never touch stimulants.
I know some young ladies do, but it is the
biggest mistake in the world, quite an
elephantine error. Dinna forget that. As
regards solid food, the more solid it is the
better; and you should now&mdash;unless stout&mdash;have
plenty of sugar and fatty food. Potatoes
and other starchy foods should be taken also.
You want to keep up the strength? Sugar is
power! Dinna you forget that.</p>

<p>Dinna forget this either: that pudding
after dinner helps to spoil the complexion.
Have fruit instead. A little vaseline&mdash;cold
cream at night will preserve the skin.
You need nothing else. Good-bye! Dinna
forget!</p>

<p class='ph3'><span class="smcap">By</span> H. MARY WILSON, Author of "In Warwick Ward," "In Monmouth Ward," "Miss Elsie," etc.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>Towards the end of a busy morning Sister
Warwick was cheered by the bright face of
her youngest sister, who had come up for a
day's shopping, and who appeared in the
ward for a few moments.</p>

<p>She went with a smile and something sunny
to say to the bedside of the one or two
patients she remembered to have seen during
her last visit. Mrs. 13 she asked after with
special interest, and paused with sudden
gravity to look at the lines on the suffering
face, just now at rest in sleep.</p>

<p>She knew Mrs. 13's story, and her heart
burnt within her as she recalled it. How she
longed for those who say that the sweating
system of ill-paid and unwholesome work is a
thing of the past to stand where she stood
and see for themselves!</p>

<p>Presently the warm-hearted girl had other
thoughts&mdash;still kind ones&mdash;in her pretty head.
She begged her elder sister to come into her
room and see what she had put there.</p>

<p>Oh, such a glorious basket of roses!</p>

<p>Sister Warwick plunged her face among
them and sighed her enjoyment, not only of
the scent, but because they had come from
home, and because a dear mother's hands had
helped to cut and pack them there.</p>

<p>"They are not for the ward or the patients
this time," said the eager young voice.
"Mother and I thought of it together. We
want one to be laid on each of the nurses'
plates at dinner to-day as a little surprise.
Do you think Miss Jameson would say 'Yes'
if I took them to the Nurses' Home?"</p>

<p>"Of course she would, dear! Only try!
And how I wish you could hear what the
nurses will say and the look on their faces
when they see a pretty, gay table where there
is usually a desert-plain of white china! It is
a nice thought!"</p>

<p>"Well, mother and I have come to the
conclusion that you working-women want
freshening with a flower sometimes as well as
the rich folk. We mean to do it again some
day. Oh, and there are quite enough to go
all round, I hope, and to leave a supply for
the Sisters' dinner this evening. We weren't
going to leave you out, you poor, tired old
thing. You look rather washed out, dear."</p>

<p>There was an anxious question in these last
words.</p>

<p>Sister Warwick told her a little about her
disturbed night, and got a loving kiss of
sympathy. Then the merry girl bustled
away, leaving behind her an atmosphere the
brighter for her coming.</p>

<p>Who more than hospital nurses appreciate
these short-lived breaks in their lives, these
little visits from their own people that flash
sunshine and warmth into the dark corners?</p>

<p>And the flowers too. What would hospital
life be without the flowers? Have we not
already seen some of the many happy uses to
which they may be put?</p>

<p class='p2'>The typhoid&mdash;No. 10&mdash;was a poor flower-girl.
She had not failed to notice how the
nurses loved the fair blossoms, and with
reviving life her warm little heart filled with
gratitude for the tenderness and care she had
received. She could only think of one vent
for her feelings.</p>

<p>"Look here, Sister," she said. "I generally
stand at the top o' Cheapside or thereabouts.
Do come my way. I'll be looking out for
you. And I'll give you such a bowkay!"</p>

<p class='p2'>Susie, if she was inclined to fret for
"mother" and "home," had a plucky little
soul with which to greet other woes. Just
to-day she was feeling it very perplexing that,
in spite of a decidedly hungry appetite, she
was knocked off her dinner altogether. She
tried not to grumble, but her face was very
wistful until Sister came and explained that
the doctors wished it, and that in the afternoon
she was to "have on a clean night-gown
and such a pretty bed-jacket that is waiting
in my room, and I shall tie up your hair with
this nice piece of blue ribbon. We are going
to take you to see the doctors instead of their
coming to see you to-day. You know how
kind they are, don't you, little maid?"</p>

<p>Susie had nothing but gentleness to remember,
and fortunately she did not connect
Sister's words with the great cruel lump on
her leg that was sapping her little life and
giving her those sudden sharp pains that often
drew her little lips together with a pathetic
"Oh!"</p>

<p>It was thus that Sister Warwick tenderly
shielded the child as much as possible from
the terrors of anticipating an unknown ordeal,
and Susie went smiling in Sister's arms to the
operating theatre. She only had one short
moment of fear when she found herself laid
on that very strange bed, with so many
strange faces round her.</p>

<p>Then she went to sleep. She supposed so,
for she opened her eyes again in the long,
quiet ward, with the bright flowers on the
table and Sister beside her, one hand resting
on her curls, and the other holding her tiny
wrist. Sister was smiling too. Seeing this,
Susie guessed there was nothing to be
frightened at, though down in her little heart
she fancied she should have been afraid of
something&mdash;she did not know what&mdash;if she
had waked to find herself alone.</p>

<p>She drank the milk that was given her, and
feeling drowsy sighed a "Good night, Sister,"
turned a very white little face sideways
upon the pillow, and slept again&mdash;this time a
natural satisfactory slumber.</p>

<p>Susie never realised what a blessed thing
had happened to her during that confused
time. For she was hardly old enough to
connect that "going to see the doctors"
with the fact that her "poor, poor leg," as
she called it, grew rapidly well from that day.</p>

<p>Happy Susie, to pass so calmly through
such a crisis in your life! and to lie in your
little cot all unconscious of the interest you
cause, not only to your doctors and nurses,
but to all the elder women in the beds up and
down this long room, who were well enough
to enter into what went on around them.
The flower-girl was one of these, and Mrs. 13
was another.</p>

<p>Patty, being a spoilt little mortal, expressed
a wish that she too might "have a pretty
hair-tie, and go to see the doctors with Sister."
She was quite jealous of all the attention
Susie was receiving, and thought herself
neglected by contrast.</p>

<p>Sister laughed, and made it all right by
saying:</p>

<p>"You shall do better than that, dear.
Some day soon we will put you into the mail-cart,
wrap you up in a pretty blue shawl, and
you shall go under the trees in the gardens."</p>

<p>So Patty had the pleasure of anticipation,
too.</p>

<h2><a name="ANSWERS_TO_CORRESPONDENTS" id="ANSWERS_TO_CORRESPONDENTS">ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</a></h2>


<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">A New Correspondent.</span>&mdash;1. Take a lukewarm bath
every day. Where you perspire most profusely
sponge the parts over with toilet vinegar and water.
A very good way to check excessive sweating, especially
if it is offensive, is to dust the inside of your
gloves, stockings and sleeves with a powder consisting
of ninety-nine parts of silica and one part of
salicylic acid, finely powdered. Wash your feet and
hands every night in warm boracic acid solution
(two teaspoonfuls of boracic acid to the quart of
water). Change your linen frequently during hot
weather.&mdash;2. The voice of the girl does not alter
so much as does that of the boy. It also "forms"
more gradually, and there is rarely or never a distinct
"cracking" of the voice of the girl like that
which usually occurs in the boy. At nineteen years
of age the speaking voice is fully formed, but the
singing voice may go on improving till thirty or
even later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span>&mdash;Anything which disturbs the health will
cause a dark sallow complexion and dark rings
round the eyes. Defective hygienic surroundings,
lack of exercise or sufficient nourishment, overwork,
or indeed anything which interferes with
perfect health will cause a sallow complexion. The
way to improve your complexion is to take plenty
of exercise, eat well, and pay attention to the general
laws of health. Cosmetics and other applications
would make your face worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daughter.</span>&mdash;Your mother suffers from hay fever. Let
her follow the advice we gave to Josephine last week.
If this proves successful so much the better. But
hay fever is a ticklish thing to treat, and but rarely
does the first treatment tried effect a cure. Snuffs
of various kinds are often used for this ailment.
We have seen better results from snuffs containing
menthol or aristol than from others. Very often a
trivial surgical man&#339;uvre, such as destroying a sensitive
spot with a prick of the electric needle will
permanently cure hay fever. Sometimes nothing
seems to do any good. Hay fever is thought by
some people to result from the pollen of flowers
irritating the mucous membrane of the nose. This
may be a cause in some cases, but it cannot
be invariably the rule. As a matter of fact a
large number of totally dissimilar affections are
lumped together and called "hay fever," and so
it is not difficult to see why the same treatment
will not be of avail to every sufferer from this
complaint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pussy.</span>&mdash;Can indigestion be cured at home? Of
course it can. Better at home than anywhere else.
The person who told you that indigestion could not
be cured without sea air is not a reliable authority.
Attention to diet is everything in indigestion. Last
year in <span class="smcap">The Girl's Own Paper</span> we published two
articles on indigestion. Let your friend read these,
and also the answers to correspondents which deal
with the subject of indigestion. We seem to be
always discussing indigestion, nervousness or face
spots. She must not eat apples either raw or
cooked. She may relieve her constipation if necessary
with a little liquorice powder or a teaspoonful
of cascara sagrada. If your friend reads what we
have advised, she will find all she needs to cure
herself of indigestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stavesacre.</span>&mdash;We are thoroughly aware that this
drug is used to destroy lice in the hair. It is not a
drug which we would advise anyone to use. It is a
violent poison, and in our experience it does not do
what it is intended to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mimosa.</span>&mdash;1. It is hardly correct to say that "nearly
every girl is anmic." A great many girls do
suffer from that malady, but "nearly every girl"
is an exaggeration. We do not think that anmia
is on the increase, if you take into consideration
the conditions under which girls live. Anmia is
always much more prevalent in cities than it is in
small towns and villages. Consequently, as our
towns grow larger, a greater number of girls get
anmia. In London we think that anmia is
slightly less common than it was formerly.&mdash;2. In
severe anmia the legs very often do swell. In
the slighter grades of the affection they only swell
after severe exertion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fond Mother.</span>&mdash;There are few places in the world
more deadly to Europeans than the Gold Coast.
If you can possibly prevent your son from going to
such an unhealthy place we strongly advise you to
do so. Very few Europeans who have set foot upon
"The White Man's Grave" recover their health
when they return home. And it is but a small
number that ever do return.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pure Water.</span>&mdash;You say that you have a porcelain
filter. Do you mean a charcoal filter in a porcelain
jar, that is, a cottage filter? or do you mean a
filter in which the water is forced through porcelain?
The latter kind of filter is thoroughly
efficient. The former kind is far worse than
useless. The question of the use and abuse of
filters has been considered by two commissions.
The latest commission was held last year. It
dealt chiefly with the value of the pocket filters
used by British soldiers. The report was very
condemnatory.</p></div>


<h3>STUDY AND STUDIO.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ben Bolt.</span>&mdash;1. We smiled at your amusing French-English
letter, but we can inform you that we only
criticise the handwriting of our correspondents
when we have been asked to do so. The request
very usually accompanies the MSS. sent to us.&mdash;2.
There is certainly room for improvement in your
English prose, but we should judge you quite
capable of making yourself competent to undertake
translations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Hathway</span>, whose society we have frequently
mentioned, writes to say that her address is now
Chambers' Library, Wokingham. Her "Excelsior
Literary Club" for essays, stories, research, subjects
of discussion, with criticism and prizes,
originated in 1877. The second term of her classes
for English subjects, French, and Italian, is now
beginning. Terms (moderate) on application, with
stamp for reply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agatha.</span>&mdash;We feel much sympathy for you.&mdash;1. Your
drawing is good, the shading being well managed
for one who has never learned. We advise you to
persevere.&mdash;2. Your writing is very clear and excellent,
considering that you have to write lying on
your back. We hope you will soon be stronger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardchullary.</span>&mdash;1. You have not given your quotation
quite correctly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The light that never was, on sea or land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The consecration, and the Poet's dream."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class='noindent'>These magnificent lines are from a poem by Wordsworth,
"suggested by a picture of Peele Castle in a
storm." They mean the light of poetic imagination,
which irradiates life, although it is not seen with
the outward eye.&mdash;2. Your writing is neat and
good, but the tails to your g's and y's, etc., are too
long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bougie's Friend</span> (Belgium).&mdash;1. We answered your
first question some time ago.&mdash;2. In reply to your
inquiry as to whether "there is no harm in flirting,"
we must tell you that there is a type of flirting which
is distinctly vulgar, and does not elevate a girl in the
eyes of the man who is amusing himself with her.
On the other hand, it is only fair to say that some
people apply the term "flirting" to very harmless
and innocent gaiety and brightness, which is perfectly
natural when young people meet together.</p></div>


<h3>INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lys de France</span>" writes to inform her many would-be
correspondents that she has already made her
choice. She adds, "You cannot imagine the
pleasure your 'International Correspondence' has
afforded me."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Erica</span>," Buda-Pesth, Hungary, has offers of correspondence
from Miss Edwards, Bibbenluke, New
South Wales; and Miss Green, G. M. King, Esq.,
Glen Rock, Spring Valley, Tarkastad, Cape Colony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie Arapian</span> has an offer of correspondence from
Miss Julia Ina Fraser, Egypt House, Newmarket
Place, Westmoreland, Jamaica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fraser</span> would "like to correspond with some
nice ladylike girls about her own age (seventeen)
in England, France and Italy, or India."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Clarissa J. Ault</span> and her sister would be glad
to have a French girl correspondent of about their
own age (nineteen to twenty-one). Address, Aulton
House, Church Gresley, Burton-on-Trent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Emma L. Young</span> is anxious to obtain a French
correspondent aged twenty-one. Address, 2, Sans
Souci, Harold Cross Road, Dublin.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Poker</span>," Cholwell House, Temple Cloud, Bristol,
wishes to correspond with a French girl aged about
eighteen, of good family. She suggests that "they
should correct each other's letters."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Lilian A. J. Slade</span>, Lawn Villa, Crewkerne,
Somerset, would like both a French and German
correspondent aged about eighteen.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">One who is puzzled</span>" wishes to correspond with
Miss Florence A. Jeffery (New York). She should
write to the address we gave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Violet Goodhart Godfrey</span>, M.L.S., wishes
for an American correspondent; she is eighteen next
January. Will an American girl (either the one
whose request we published on August 6th, or another)
write to her at Ivy Hatch, Horsham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gertrude</span> wishes for a French correspondent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem</span> wishes to exchange letters with a French, German,
or Italian lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss E. Watkinson</span>, Wanaka, The Vale, Chelsea,
wishes to correspond with a young lady of her own
age (twenty-four) in Canada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignoramus</span> wishes for a French girl correspondent of
seventeen to twenty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy Cross</span>, Minterne, Cerne, Dorset, and <span class="smcap">Miss
Madelina Pullin</span>, The Parsonage Farm, Warminster,
Wilts, wish to correspond with French
girls aged about fourteen.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Cissie</span>," Southend, should send her full name and
address.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">A Reader of the 'G. O. P.,' J. B. Ashford</span>,"
a girl aged seventeen, wishes for either a French
or German correspondent, or both. Address,
55, Marlow Road, Anerley, London, S.E.</p></div>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dombey.</span>&mdash;We have not made the experiment ourselves,
but we have heard that you may restore a
faded photograph by placing it in a saturated
solution of bichloride of mercury, leaving it in the
bath for a few minutes, and then washing and
drying it; of course it must be unmounted. There
is another method; but whatever experiment you
make should be first tried on one which is of no
value to you. For our part, we should prefer to
leave the photo in the experienced hands of a
professional artist, and we cannot take any responsibility
in giving the foregoing recipe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marta.</span>&mdash;There is no cruelty attached to the trade
in ostrich feathers. The birds are not killed, excepting
only at Buenos Ayres, to provide the
market with them; nor are they made to suffer
from plucking like the poor geese, to supply quill
pens. Each plume is cut with a sharp knife close
to the skin, and this gives no pain any more than
the cutting of our hair. The stumps wither and
fall out; or after ten days may be removed. The
greatest supply comes from the Cape; but they are
also produced in Tripoli, Egypt, and Morocco.
But the trade prices for birds has much gone down.</p>

<p>A. B.&mdash;The name "Collect," as applied to the short
prayer employed before the Epistle and Gospel,
simply expressed the fact that it has reference to
the main subjects of the latter extracts collected
together. The term "Bible" only meant "a book"
in the time of Chaucer. It has been restricted in
its application to the Divinely-inspired collection
of writings, and the article "the" was super-added.
And so the term "Scriptures" is employed with
the definite article, to show that these writings are
separate from all others; sometimes the word
"holy" being further employed to mark them as
standing alone, and in a rank superior to that of any
others, however distinguished and authoritative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edith.</span>&mdash;Should anyone step on your foot, or accidentally
push against you, and apologise, say "Not
at all, don't mention it." Do not say "All right,"
and certainly not the vulgar reply, "Granted,"
from which an inference could naturally be drawn
that you considered an apology was due, which
would not be complimentary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L. E. Bird.</span>&mdash;The initial letters placed on an invitation
card&mdash;"R. S. V. P."&mdash;are those of the French
words, <i>Rpondez, s'il vous plait</i>, which, translated
into English, means, "Answer, if you please."
Your handwriting is scarcely formed, but very
legible, and promises well for a running hand, with
practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span>&mdash;You had better transact the business
through the <i>Exchange and Mart</i>. Get one of the
papers to see their terms (70, Strand, W.C., Office
of the <i>Bazaar</i>. <i>E. &amp; M.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence A. Jeffery.</span>&mdash;A halfpenny of William
and Mary, with plain edge, and the date under
Britannia, "1694" (in copper) is worth from 1s. to
5s.; but some examples have sold for much more.
Three halfpennies, one Irish, have been sold for
1 12s., but they were very fine specimens. Another
of 1694, of bold work, extremely fine, realised 7 10s.
A halfpenny of George II. is worth from 6d. to a 1s.
The head of the date you name, "1754," is an old one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. Maxwell.</span>&mdash;We must refer you to the 1st volume
of <i>The Oracle Encyclopdia</i> (Geo. Newnes, Ltd.),
page 619, where you will read&mdash;"In the old Church
of St. Martin, built in the 12th or 13th c., Roman
bricks and Norman sculpture have been worked-up
in the walls!"</p>

<p>M. D.&mdash;We recommend you to dispose of the medical
books through the <i>Exchange and Mart</i> (70,
Strand, W.C.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silkworm</span> might offer her silk for disposal through
the medium of the above-named paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span>&mdash;The French obtained the soubriquet of
"frogs" not because of their using these creatures
as food, because we find that the southern Germans,
Austrians, and Italians esteem the green ones in
the same way, as delicacies of the table, but the
name was derived from the original heraldic device
of their kings, who bore on their escutcheons "three
toads (or frogs) erect, saltent." In the year 1791,
"What will the frogs say?" was a common phrase
of the Court at Versailles, applied to the citizens of
Paris. The site of this city was once a quagmire, or
swamp, like that of London, and was called <i>Luttia</i>,
or "mud land," its inhabitants living like the
frogs, in the mud. September 20th, 1885, fell on a
Sunday.</p>

<p>C. W. N.&mdash;We like your "Reverie." It shows much
poetical feeling; but a little flaw at the commencement
might be corrected. The nave cannot be
said to be "pierced" by the aisle, an arch, nor even
by the column. They do not go through the roof.
We do not say this satirically, but because the full
and correct meaning of words must be remembered
and strictly employed in their true sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May.</span>&mdash;Hermanszoon van Rhyn Rembrandt was a
Dutch painter and engraver; born in 1608, and
died in 1669. If your picture be signed, it is
valuable. Search the corners carefully for any
initials, date, or mark. You do not name the
subject.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
